2020-02-22,Getting there was super hard. Very proud of Tesla team!
2020-02-22,Model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing
2020-02-22,"Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient & range, latter factoring in route elevation changes & cargo or tow mass & drag impact"
2020-02-22,It’s slightly better
2020-02-22,Definitely worth trying imo
2020-02-21,"Btw, in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights."
2020-02-21,Active ride height & active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
2020-02-21,Science has gone too far
2020-02-21, 
2020-02-20,F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production & thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
2020-02-20,"It’s mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light & back is heavy due to engines & landing legs."
2020-02-20,"Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main."
2020-02-20,LOX
2020-02-20,These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply #of iterations * progress between iterations.
2020-02-20,Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full & rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
2020-02-20,Probably
2020-02-20,Attach wheels to the landing legs & tow Starship to the launch pad
2020-02-20,I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
2020-02-20,"High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks & fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done!"
2020-02-20,"The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit"
2020-02-20,"There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine."
2020-02-20,"Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters."
2020-02-20,"O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank"
2020-02-20,In the order that they were written
2020-02-20,Worth reading Asimov’s Foundation https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series
2020-02-19,"SN 2+ will have better fit & weld quality. Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings, so much less weld length."

2020-02-17,"All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated, including Tesla"
2020-02-17,I have no control & only very limited insight into OpenAI. Confidence in Dario for safety is not high.
2020-02-17,OpenAI should be more open imo
2020-02-16,"Initially, yes, but then will make sense to localize closer to customers. Pretty much same plan as vehicles."
2020-02-16,Looking forward to international expansion later this year 
2020-02-16,"Tesla is ramping up Solar Roof installation across the USA! Training will be provided, so no prior experience needed. Apply at"
2020-02-15,Direct links aren’t needed to offer service. Starlink will initially bounce signals off ground/ocean relays to get from to .
2020-02-15, albedo will drop significantly on almost every successive launch
2020-02-15,Haha
2020-02-15,"Sorry, probably going to be a lot of rocket pics from @archillect "
2020-02-15,X will also improve by a similar amount
2020-02-15,"Depends on when car was built, as there are many small hardware improvements, so most will be somewhere in between 373 & 390"
2020-02-15,"Regulations require calling it something else, so we added +"
2020-02-15,"There’s a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant."
2020-02-15,Maybe possible with improved wheels/tires (which would be available to all previously made cars)
2020-02-15,All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.
2020-02-15,Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km
2020-02-15,Run a physics sim long enough & you’ll get intelligence

2020-02-14,"The joints will have shielding, but it’s hard to ensure a good seal. Transpiration cooling (or simply higher pressure cold gas flow) would purge the area behind the hot gas seal."
2020-02-14,Might be used around flap joints
2020-02-14,Will take action
2020-02-14,Only the heart senses beauty
2020-02-14,Shielding is only needed for orbital speeds
2020-02-13, be still my beating heart 
2020-02-13,"Unfortunately, Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side, but none required on leeward. Even windward shielding is very light."

2020-02-12,Whoop whoop!!
2020-02-12,Thanks Mom!!! @mayemusk
2020-02-12,This does seem high
2020-02-12,And some vitamin k too
2020-02-12,Ok u can have a little emerald 
2020-02-10,This is incorrect. No air suspension planned for 3/Y. Only S/X & Cybertruck have/will have air suspension.
2020-02-10,Æsthetics
2020-02-10,The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics & energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
2020-02-10,"Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass & several other products. Will also offer customer & media tours."
2020-02-10,Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
2020-02-10,"Its integrated roof & solar, so should be light enough for almost any home"
2020-02-10,Coming hopefully later this year
2020-02-10,"I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice & snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!"
2020-02-10,"No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles."
2020-02-10,Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust & weathering. This pic is brand new.
2020-02-10,Ok
2020-02-10,Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
2020-02-10,Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.
2020-02-10,"Probably 6 months or so. 301 is certainly fine for orbit, but SpaceX 30X will be better."

2020-02-10,"Yes, but we want to focus on textured black first, then move into Earth tones & convolutions"
2020-02-10,Your comment above: “Who in their right mind would buy an ICE after 2025 knowing its residual value will be zilch? Legacy auto: go EV or go BUST!” is super important for car buyers. Residual values for gas/diesel cars will plummet in coming years.

2020-02-07,You’re welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
2020-02-07,"Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter."
2020-02-07,"No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time."
2020-02-07,"Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering & building a heavy duty planisher to flatten & cold work the weld area"
2020-02-07,"That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume."
2020-02-07,"This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures & welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."
2020-02-07,"SpaceX started with a mariachi band party. Great vibes here in Boca Chica, Texas!"

2020-02-03,"First, we need to make it super safe & easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production & implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards."
2020-02-03,"Ok sure Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory."

2020-02-03,"It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don’t want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain & motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo."

2020-02-03,"Yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better."
2020-02-03,PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
2020-02-03,"Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control & entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test."
2020-02-03,"The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans & has severe drawbacks."
2020-02-03,Sorry!
2020-02-02,A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI & ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). Don’t care if you even graduated high school.
2020-02-02,"Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency"
2020-02-02,Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.
2020-02-02,"We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto & Austin"
2020-02-02,"Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data & efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory & ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later."

2020-02-01,"This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank, among many other things"
2020-02-01,Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse & ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.

2020-01-17,Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars.
2020-01-17,Yes
2020-01-17,That’s the goal
2020-01-17,Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
2020-01-17,"Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at >100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit"
2020-01-17,Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary

2020-01-16,"What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity."

2020-01-16,"Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! tragedy."
2020-01-16,"Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!"

2020-01-14,"Very true. What’s really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs & how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth’s surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun."

2020-01-10,Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
2020-01-10,"Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
2020-01-10,A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps & pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
2020-01-10,"Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts & better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."

2019-12-30,We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship & Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
2019-12-30,Spin start from COPVs so the ox & fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
2019-12-30,"Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc & steel melt pool."
2019-12-30,"No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 & O2 from Raptor"
2019-12-30,Yeah
2019-12-30,"Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts & fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020."
2019-12-30,"Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed & TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints & 20% mass reduction."
2019-12-30,"We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome."

2019-12-29,"Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever."
2019-12-29,"Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else & directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
2019-12-29,Pretty much
2019-12-29,Sure. Trax will get much better & more fun. This is an alpha version.
2019-12-29,"No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic & it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
2019-12-29,"That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."

2019-12-28,"He didn’t own an emerald mine & I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night & website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?"

2019-11-08,Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
2019-11-08,"SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle & no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
2019-11-08,"Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
2019-11-08,Pretty much
2019-11-08,"Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting & inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
2019-11-08,"No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous & difficult than Earth & take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?"
2019-11-07,"So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
2019-11-07,As the planets align only once every two years
2019-11-07,A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
2019-11-07,No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
2019-11-07,"Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
2019-11-07,"If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles & each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
2019-11-07,"Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"

2019-11-04,"That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
2019-11-04,"Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days & requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours & ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
2019-11-04,Great poem

2019-10-28,"We don’t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot"
2019-10-28,"If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today"

2019-10-28,So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas & being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
2019-10-28,"Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important. https://www.zillow.com/research/solar-panels-house-sell-more-23798/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"

2019-10-27,Took my son to play piano for the seniors home in Pasadena. It was lovely to see them smile 
2019-10-27,Thanks to everyone at Tesla who worked so hard over the years to make our Fremont factory successful!

2019-10-26,"Yes, you can walk on the Tesla Solarglass roof. In stilettos, if you want "
2019-10-26,Jerome is great! Tesla team in general is the strongest its ever been.
2019-10-25,"Yes, wight destruction guaranteed or your money back!"
2019-10-25,Tesla Solarglass roof
2019-10-25,Will start at ~2:15. Sorry for slight delay.
2019-10-25,Haha true
2019-10-25,Srsly
2019-10-25,Transparent aluminum is a real thing!
2019-10-25,"That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power, not inert!"
2019-10-25,"Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!"
2019-10-25,"Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first, but then improve rapidly."

2019-10-24,"Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth."
2019-10-24,"To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended"

2019-10-17,Both at the same time!
2019-10-17,More about dealing with failure modes & roll control
2019-10-17,"Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well."
2019-10-17,"Common myth, but incorrect"

2019-10-15,Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing & building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
2019-10-15,Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
2019-10-15,"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …"
2019-10-15,"Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
2019-10-15,"Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
2019-10-15,And the lead character is also named Woody
2019-10-15,"Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
2019-10-14,Conservation of energy tells you the answer
2019-10-14,Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
2019-10-14,"We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place & only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room & moment of inertia is much lower."
2019-10-14,"Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
2019-10-14,"Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
2019-10-14,"Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
2019-10-14,Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect
2019-10-14,"This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v"
2019-10-14,"Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen & oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters."
2019-10-14,"We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces."
2019-10-14,"Yeah, great team!"
2019-10-14,"To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth."
2019-10-14,"Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
2019-10-14,"Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space."
2019-10-14,"Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear & drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly …"
2019-10-14,Software
2019-10-14,Yes
2019-10-14,Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon

2019-10-14,"Yes, we will"
2019-10-14,"It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when & how fast to move the wipers."
2019-10-14,"Deep Rain neural net coming soon. We’re not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep."
2019-10-14,"Yep, good catch"
2019-10-14, hot pot
2019-10-14,Cybertruck doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen bouncing around the Internet. It’s closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future.

2019-10-13,"Underappreciated , will watch!"
2019-10-13,Is Space Jam good?
2019-10-13,So it goes

2019-10-12,Solar
2019-10-12,"Depends on total system efficiency & how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess"
2019-10-12,"Whoa, that does look good!"
2019-10-12,Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.
2019-10-12,French fries are the devil 
2019-10-12,".@DrPatSoonShiong, are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?"
2019-10-12,Super messed up situation!
2019-10-12,Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
2019-10-12,Should be much better at this point
2019-10-12,Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
2019-10-12,"Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …"
2019-10-12,"Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist."
2019-10-12,Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
2019-10-12,"V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout."
2019-10-12,"When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many & much better than driving a single car."
2019-10-12,Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
2019-10-12, 
2019-10-12,"Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released."
2019-10-12,"Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive."
2019-10-12,"Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1"
2019-10-12,Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power & no more blackouts!
2019-10-12,Will be throughout Canada
2019-10-11,It’s something special
2019-10-10,Fundamental metric of good of Tesla is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future
2019-10-10,True 
2019-10-10,I Asterix &amp; Obelix!
2019-10-10,Exactly
2019-10-10,Ok
2019-10-10,Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is 24/7 clean power with no blackouts.

2019-10-01,Lot of ways to melt & join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently & with precise parts.
2019-10-01,Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right & not needed with steel.
2019-10-01,"Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see"

2019-09-27,"Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing & machining of Raptor — far more than in design of the engine itself!"
2019-09-27,There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
2019-09-27,Yes
2019-09-27,"Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints & dissimilar metals at such high pressure & temperature is what I find remarkable about it."
2019-09-27,"No, we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have & we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight."
2019-09-27,Probably around 6 or 7pm

2019-09-24,"Better just to ride your max temp all the way down & let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing."
2019-09-24,"Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat."
2019-09-24,"It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating"

2019-09-24,"“Between the trees and the forest floor, it’s like a giant mural,” continued the veritable High Priest of the Harvest Season, adding that he would soon have to rake his driveway, an activity for which he will most certainly don a cashmere scarf."
2019-09-23,"Hoping to open in Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia & most of Eastern Europe early next year. Finally, we will do Nikola Tesla proud by having his cars in his countries of origin!"
2019-09-23,OG Roadster is def helping us out here with 826M miles by itself
2019-09-23,Ahem … well … um …
2019-09-23,"Classified as a URO, unidentified road object (from Area 69)"
2019-09-23,"SpaceX Foundry is used exclusively for advanced alloys/shapes for Raptor, incl our superalloy, SX500"
2019-09-23,Bottom half of Starship at night. Top half with forward fins & header tanks probably stacks on Wednesday. Three Raptors already installed.

2019-09-22,"Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 & a skydiver."
2019-09-22, 
2019-09-22,Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle & ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
2019-09-22,"For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass & pressure."
2019-09-22,"Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
2019-09-22,"Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear & fwd fins during entry & landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg."
2019-09-22,Stability is not an issue with 3
2019-09-22,"Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors & rear fins at the bottom."
2019-09-22,"Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out."
2019-09-22,"Adding the rear moving fins to Starship Mk1 in Boca Chica, Texas"
2019-09-22,Thanks!

2019-09-21,Yes
2019-09-21,Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering! The Crew Dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem. The Apollo program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale problem!

2019-09-17,Exactly
2019-09-17,"Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on Nürburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range"
2019-09-17,"No, but very close"
2019-09-17,"Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys & Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago."
2019-09-17,Absolutely
2019-09-17,New Roadster and X will come later
2019-09-17,"No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before."
2019-09-17,It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.

2019-09-15,Joe Mode is the best mode
2019-09-15,Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!! 
2019-09-14,Wise words from Gary the Bot
2019-09-14,"However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla & customer legal bill to be high & drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense."
2019-09-14,Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at http://Tesla.com/bigsolar.
2019-09-14,"Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California & one Gigafactory (for batteries & drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries & drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs & improve logistics worldwide."
2019-09-14,"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
2019-09-14,"That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
2019-09-14,"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
2019-09-14,"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
2019-09-14,Agreed
2019-09-14,"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
2019-09-14,"There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
2019-09-14,"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."
2019-09-14,"Hopefully, next year"

2019-09-10,Exactly
2019-09-10,Looks good
2019-09-10,The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration & acoustics.
2019-09-10,48 61 20 68 61
2019-09-10,"The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal."
2019-09-09,"Failure rate is actually both higher & lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate."
2019-09-09,Precisely
2019-09-09,"Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok."
2019-09-09, 
2019-09-09,You know destination weather before departure & there’s no weather in space
2019-09-09,"Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins."
2019-09-09,"Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell & fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull."
2019-09-09,"Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability."
2019-09-09,"Over time, 355 & 385 are possible, but very difficult"
2019-09-09,Most likely
2019-09-09,Photoshop is amazing

2019-09-07,Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.
2019-09-07,"Very exciting to see India’s rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall."

2019-09-05,"Still too buggy to be in wide EAP. Requires more testing. Hopefully, going to wide EAP next week."
2019-09-05,It’s up to &amp; as to whether they go with EU rules or rest of world. Not our choice.
2019-09-04,"Same, except where limited by EU regulations. We’re aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this & are working with EU regulators to address."
2019-09-04,"In close traffic, poisonous gas spewing from the car in front of you goes straight into your AC intake. Good thing gas/diesel carmakers didn’t cheat on their emissions or we’d be in real trouble "

2019-08-29,Yes
2019-08-29, Iceland for sure!
2019-08-29,"Very soon, sorry for the delay"
2019-08-28,"Aiming for 20km flight in Oct & orbit attempt shortly thereafter. Starship update will be on Sept 28th, anniversary of SpaceX reaching orbit. Starship Mk 1 will be fully assembled by that time."
2019-08-28,Probably 2 to 3 months. We’re about to ship Raptor SN 10.
2019-08-28,Probably 18m for next gen system
2019-08-28,"Would love to, but import duties are extremely high, even for electric vehicles"

2019-08-27,Impressively accurate analysis!
2019-08-27,Hopefully next year
2019-08-27, 
2019-08-27,Appears to be a wiring/connector issue
2019-08-27,Igniters need to be inspected. We will try again tomorrow same time.
2019-08-26,"Raptor uses dual redundant torch igniters. Better long-term, but more finicky in development."

2019-08-24,World’s first very large scale battery has worked out well
2019-08-24,"Yes, last flight for Hopper. If all goes well, it will become a vertical test stand for Raptor."
2019-08-24,Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
2019-08-24,"Agreed, that’s the right future"
2019-08-24,Looks like @SpaceX Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!
2019-08-24,We’re working closely with EU regulators & hope to clarify the timeline soon

2019-08-21,Wow
2019-08-20,Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
2019-08-20,"Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes"
2019-08-20,"Not risky imo & can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun)."
2019-08-20,"True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids & a mass driver, but this is risky."
2019-08-20,"Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive."
2019-08-20,"Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins & landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September"
2019-08-20,Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
2019-08-20,"Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth & gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming"

2019-08-20,Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
2019-08-20,"AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based."
2019-08-20,"Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters"
2019-08-20,"Initially Model 3, later Y"
2019-08-20,Looking forward to seeing Giga Shanghai soon Amazing work by Tesla China team &amp; support of authorities much appreciated!

2019-08-18,Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think …
2019-08-18,Which means a small corner of Texas (or anywhere) with solar panels could power the entire United States
2019-08-18,1 Gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches Earth’s surface

2019-08-10,Passing fad. Like steam engines. They look cool in a museum.
2019-08-10,Because our universe is actually a microverse in a miniverse. We probably just power someone’s brake lights.
2019-08-09,"Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge "
2019-08-09,"Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes"
2019-08-09,"Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully & immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly . Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real."
2019-08-09,"Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B"

2019-08-09,Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
2019-08-09,For sure
2019-08-09,Yup
2019-08-09,Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.
2019-08-09,Gas cars are so last-century!
2019-08-09,Priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with FSD
2019-08-09,"We’re accelerating opening up configurator/order page for more countries. Sorry, lot on our plate!"
2019-08-09,"Probably every 2 to 4 months, depending on how much progress we make"
2019-08-09,Video is amazing with the Tesla sound system. Will include Caraoke!

2019-08-09,No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
2019-08-09,"Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights."
2019-08-09,Thanks George!
2019-08-08,"We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world."
2019-08-08,But actual road data is what matters most
2019-08-08,"Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident."
2019-08-08,"Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …"

2019-08-04,I dare say that could use a nice 
2019-08-04,"Yes, detailed review of the first orbital Starship, explaining the pros & cons of each design decision"
2019-08-04,We are tiny
2019-08-04,"Very convincing! Ok, Boca it is. We should have Starship Mk1 with 3 Raptors almost ready to fly by then."
2019-08-04,I would’ve been bankrupt too. Unlikely investors would have funded a second attempt.
2019-08-04,Relief
2019-08-04,"Ok, will discuss with team"
2019-08-04,Sure
2019-08-03,"Also, you can request any service from the Tesla phone app in under a minute"
2019-08-03,"August 24th, either at Cape Canaveral or Boca Chica"
2019-08-03,"That was our last chance to reach orbit. If it had failed, SpaceX would have died."
2019-08-03,Yes
2019-08-03,Will also be launching The Boring Company China on this trip
2019-08-02,Good idea
2019-08-02,You’re most welcome!
2019-08-01,Fates loves irony
2019-08-01,"For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes."
2019-08-01,Not sure. Will check with my team.
2019-08-01,"I’m told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable."
2019-08-01,"Orbital refilling is vital to humanity’s future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first."
2019-07-31,Fixing …
2019-07-31,Depot haha
2019-07-31,Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.

2019-07-28,System automatically selects between mobile service & service center appointment. Say prefer mobile in comments to bias. We will add a check box for mobile preferred.
2019-07-28,Tesla owners can schedule service appointments in under a minute just using their Tesla phone app!
2019-07-28,"We’re working on it. Agreed, Minecraft is high priority. Roblox too."
2019-07-28,Sure
2019-07-28,Haha probably true (sigh)
2019-07-28,"Depends on how release to owners with early access goes, but hopefully wide release by end of August"
2019-07-28,Tesla Service Centers & a lot more Superchargers coming to Poland later this year
2019-07-28,Will recognize & read all signs for FSD. Focused on traffic lights & stop signs right now. Most are very easy. Difficulty is millions of corner cases.
2019-07-28,"Hoping to get “Joe Mode” into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting “Joe Mode” would lower the volume of strident beeps & chimes by half."
2019-07-28,"If not immediately, will be followed shortly in a point release"
2019-07-28,Yes
2019-07-28,Some
2019-07-28,"Not currently in V10, but will try"
2019-07-28,"Yes, V10 will include several games & infotainment features, improved highway Autopilot, better traffic light & stop sign recognition & Smart Summon"
2019-07-27,Can’t you just play though phone Bluetooth?
2019-07-27,"We’re close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe 2 to 3 months."
2019-07-27,"Maybe August, not more than a few months"
2019-07-27,"Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound"
2019-07-27,"When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving"
2019-07-27,"Ability to stream YouTube & Netflix when car is stopped coming to your Tesla soon! Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats & surround sound audio."
2019-07-27,"Yes, really enjoyed it, although wish she’d made it up to sky city"
2019-07-27,"Unity port is done, so finessing the controls now. Mostly limited by local storage. Will allow additional game storage via USB. Whatever’s most fun!"

2019-07-25,Probably 1/4 to 1/2 of that capacity would be for stationary storage
2019-07-25,Launch underway
2019-07-25,"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"
2019-07-25,Pc (chamber pressure) high due to colder than expected propellant
2019-07-25,Thin tiles on windward side of ship & nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
2019-07-25,"Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe."
2019-07-25,Wearing black not recommended
2019-07-25,"High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren’t hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective."

2019-07-22, tough
2019-07-22,"To be clear: good for in-space transit, but not recommended for Earth to orbit!"
2019-07-22,Very unlikely

2019-07-21,I have the t-shirt
2019-07-20,Won’t change. Starship launch structure will be attached to the other side from tower.
2019-07-20,Starship launch structure is being built off-site in steel subsections
2019-07-20,2 to 3 months after that
2019-07-20,It *is* vision
2019-07-20,I suspect many besides SpaceX will livestream these flights. Won’t be subtle.
2019-07-19,Texas and Florida Starship prototypes (not Hopper) fly in 2 to 3 months
2019-07-19,Made with rain 
2019-07-19,Coming soon
2019-07-19,Yes
2019-07-19,Tesla Service Centers & Superchargers are being opened as fast as possible across Eastern Europe
2019-07-18,"This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket & space station technology. Great respect."
2019-07-18,"No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot"
2019-07-18,"Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as you’d expect."
2019-07-18,Maybe end of next year
2019-07-18,Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
2019-07-18,"Post test fuel leak, but no major damage"
2019-07-18,Aiming for hover test next week
2019-07-18,"Yeah, big advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel: not bothered by a little heat!"
2019-07-18,"This non-Autopilot graph is not correct, as it includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features"
2019-07-18,Good piece
2019-07-18,I mostly drive Model S Performance with dev version of FSD computer. Our new Raven powertain & adaptive damping suspension is great! Next is Model 3P & then X if driving with my kids. Acceleration is fun on tap!

2019-07-17,About to go live
2019-07-17,Not easy getting a lightsaber into backpack
2019-07-17,Approximately 6.9km/s
2019-07-17, SpaceX has Area 59 
2019-07-17,"Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP"
2019-07-16,"“If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.” — Gen Shinseki"
2019-07-16,"As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit."
2019-07-16,Probably
2019-07-16,Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
2019-07-16,Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
2019-07-16,"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them & we won’t be able to."
2019-07-16,"No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers"
2019-07-16,"If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"
2019-07-16,Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.

2019-07-13,Haha yes
2019-07-13,"Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers."
2019-07-13,"Yeah, that’s next after summon"
2019-07-13,"Will trace back inertial measurements & wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off"

2019-07-12,"About right, but dangerously chuggy & risking bad things at 40%. We’ll keep it above 50% for this flight."
2019-07-12,"More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin θ/2, as I recall, but doesn’t matter, as there’s no geo anywhere near that mass."
2019-07-12,3
2019-07-12,"100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never."

2019-07-09,That was a real sign
2019-07-09,"I actually asked Ashlee Vance not to write the book several times. Inevitably, some things are wrong and then those errors are repeated for years."
2019-07-09,True
2019-07-09,Exactly
2019-07-09,No
2019-07-09,No
2019-07-09,"There is no “refreshed” Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model 3 rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production 3 months ago."

2019-07-08,"Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising."
2019-07-08,Exactly
2019-07-08,Sure 
2019-07-08,"To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car"
2019-07-08,"Between first development engine & first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware & software. Over time, thousands."
2019-07-08,Upgrading to 250kW soon
2019-07-08,"Intersections with complex traffic lights & shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety."
2019-07-08,Local supporters will be invited!
2019-07-08,Yes
2019-07-08,~Q4 2016
2019-07-08,"End of Q4, most likely"
2019-07-08,"Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies."
2019-07-08,This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k & make at least ~500k FSD cars
2019-07-08,All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer & all production in past few months has FSD computer

2019-06-30,"FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years."
2019-06-30,"Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less & convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines"
2019-06-29,"Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves."
2019-06-29,Huge thanks to all Tesla supporters around the world helping the cause. We you!!

2019-06-28,If only we’d listened …
2019-06-28, 
2019-06-28,"But, if you’re going to buy a merkin, be sure to haggle properly!"

2019-06-27,We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
2019-06-27,Design & production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_St._Louis
2019-06-27,2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
2019-06-27,That’s actually kinda true
2019-06-26,Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower & Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
2019-06-26,You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
2019-06-26,"That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent."
2019-06-26,"~1000, as all seats would be “coach” & no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
2019-06-26,"About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
2019-06-26,"That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher & stability of booster in ground winds is low"
2019-06-26,There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
2019-06-26,"Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."
2019-06-26,"Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work."
2019-06-26,Probably sooner
2019-06-26,Ok
2019-06-26,"Sure, that would be an honor"
2019-06-26,Most likely. It is programmed to do so.

2019-06-26,I know … sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
2019-06-26,"Yes, but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well."
2019-06-25,Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
2019-06-25,High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
2019-06-25,Center core RUD. It was a long shot.

2019-06-24,Falcon Heavy on LC-39A
2019-06-24,"All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox & fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness & needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms "
2019-06-24,It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
2019-06-24,"Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock & strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
2019-06-24,"Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
2019-06-24,Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals & bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
2019-06-24,So cool
2019-06-24,Anything with high contrast
2019-06-24,Excessive shades of grey
2019-06-24,"Yeah, we’ve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous."
2019-06-24,"Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy & immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps."
2019-06-24,Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
2019-06-24,Haha
2019-06-24,Depends on destination
2019-06-24,"Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level"
2019-06-24,"Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."
2019-06-24,Chomsky sucks
2019-06-24,"Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite"
2019-06-24,Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
2019-06-24,"More than that now, but <10% of that in volume, although much to be proven"
2019-06-24,"Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year."
2019-06-24,"Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design & replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."

2019-06-10,Absolutely agree. Major expansion of service centers underway.
2019-06-10,Super fair criticism. We’re putting max resources on this. Hard to hire enough repair technicians in Norway! Please apply if interested.

2019-06-10,"Good point. Maybe we could collect rainwater, add a little antifreeze in cold climates & make it last for years."

2019-06-04,"Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings"
2019-06-04,"Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph. TBC loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. That’s 57,600/hour/lane & you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput & convenience."

2019-05-30,Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto & oil companies aren’t known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors & space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
2019-05-30,"Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity & ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20."
2019-05-30,"Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result."
2019-05-30,Wings/flaps & leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn’t affect schedule much though.

2019-05-29,Edgy move
2019-05-28,Good idea
2019-05-28,True. I’m a gamer & my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
2019-05-28,Yup
2019-05-27,Would love to do exactly that
2019-05-27,"Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits & arrays are tracking to sun."
2019-05-27,"Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."
2019-05-27,Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.

2019-05-27,"Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers"
2019-05-27,"If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris"
2019-05-27,"There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully & will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible."
2019-05-27,"No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency."
2019-05-26,Fair
2019-05-25,Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy & internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
2019-05-25,Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites & allow some amount of yaw steering.
2019-05-25,"Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
2019-05-25,"Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density & thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp & up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum."

2019-05-24,Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
2019-05-24,Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps & elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
2019-05-24,"Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below"
2019-05-24,"Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly & directly that it doesn’t matter"

2019-05-24,Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.

2019-05-01,Good question
2019-04-30,What should be developed on Ethereum?
2019-04-30,"Of 14M futures, 13.9M were simply death by boredom"
2019-04-30,Naturally Ramanujan
2019-04-30,How many futures are there actually?
2019-04-30,Stop giving away free ETH! 
2019-04-30,And yet people ask what could possibly go wrong with AI

2019-04-29,Starships on Mars
2019-04-29,Yes
2019-04-29,Damn haters
2019-04-29,Starship on the moon
2019-04-29,Our competitors do
2019-04-29,We don’t buy advertising
2019-04-29,Where’s the proof!?
2019-04-29,Genau
2019-04-29,Might be boring
2019-04-29,Physics is a set of compression functions for the simulation
2019-04-29,It’s pretty much the only theory. This will mess with your mind: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude
2019-04-29,Sensors are for the weak. Just go open loop.
2019-04-29,So true
2019-04-29,As sure as night follows day
2019-04-29,Schrödinger is a probability distribution in the shape of a cat
2019-04-29,Any observation of Schrödinger changes Schrödinger
2019-04-29,"Once had a Great Dane named Hamlet, because Hamlet was a great Dane"
2019-04-29,The only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid!
2019-04-29,That’s them! Schrödinger is neither here nor there.
2019-04-29,Not as far as I know
2019-04-29,"We have a big dog called Gatsby, a little dog called Marvin the Martian & a cat named Schrödinger"
2019-04-29,Yes
2019-04-28,"Quantum mechanics was harder than all my other courses combined, but so incredible"
2019-04-28,"NVIDIA is a great company, but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving, whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs."
2019-04-28,I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
2019-04-28,"21 TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you can’t transfer data fast enough between computer & GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant."
2019-04-28,"Exactly, Tesla & Nvidia numbers described by Pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net"
2019-04-27,We’re working on it. Takes time to get all regulatory approvals. Almost there for the larger US states. At least 6 to 12 months for Europe/UK.
2019-04-27,Certain regulatory agencies would beg to differ 
2019-04-27,1

2019-04-24,Can order online in 2 mins for home delivery & return in 7 days for full refund http://Tesla.com
2019-04-24,New Model S has 370 mile / 595 km range
2019-04-24,Perhaps the Internet has some helpful suggestions?
2019-04-24,Can’t think of anything
2019-04-24,Someone else thought of an electric blower first? What!?
2019-04-24,Tesla blows haha
2019-04-23,We can probably just repurpose Model 3 HVAC parts. Not a big deal.
2019-04-23,True
2019-04-23,Long lasting battery + fast recharge > pack swap
2019-04-23,Haha ok
2019-04-23,"It’s been suggested by many, externally & internally"
2019-04-23,Aren’t there good ones already?

2019-04-23,Will do
2019-04-23,Absolutely
2019-04-23,Seriously
2019-04-23,"Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez …"
2019-04-23,"Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV’s have high fire risk when opposite is true."
2019-04-23,"Thanks, support super appreciated"
2019-04-23,Sad if true 
2019-04-23,"When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious."
2019-04-23,"Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?"
2019-04-23,"Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year & thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
2019-04-23,"Those who predicted Tesla & EVs would be dead & autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"
2019-04-23,Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars & autonomy was between 10 years & never …
2019-04-23,Anti-matter def wins on energy density 
2019-04-23,"Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) & we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year."
2019-04-23,"As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost & larger range pack needed."

2019-04-23,Is that a real billboard?
2019-04-23,We’ll let the NN loose on Track Mode one day … that’ll be insane
2019-04-23,Reddit is hardcore. Mostly correct analysis. Comments so dark …
2019-04-23,Or maybe pegging
2019-04-23,"On yeah, that too"
2019-04-23,"Exactly. Also, you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds."

2019-04-14,We will. You read it right.
2019-04-14,Haha true
2019-04-14,I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport & energy
2019-04-14,"Good point, small oil is a problem too"
2019-04-14,"I’m sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal & gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels …"
2019-04-14,"Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false."
2019-04-14,"True, Bloomberg is almost as bad"
2019-04-14,Holman Jenkins & WSJ in general are sock puppets of big oil
2019-04-14,Starship is kinda Gundam
2019-04-14,"Very much so. There are 2.5B cars & trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -> demand >> supply."

2019-04-14,"Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve."
2019-04-14,"There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints."
2019-04-13,Yes
2019-04-13,"Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date"
2019-04-13,"Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability"
2019-04-13,Yes

2019-04-13,"Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later."
2019-04-13,Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
2019-04-13,Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr & have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
2019-04-13,Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
2019-04-13,Something like that

2019-04-13,Model 3 drive unit & body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.

2019-04-06,Starhopper just lifted off & hit tether limits!
2019-04-05,Max thrust of 2550 tons will be almost 10% higher than Falcon Heavy demo mission last year
2019-04-05,"Static fire data looks good so far. This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block 5, so we’re being extra cautious. Launch date might move."
2019-04-05,Exactly
2019-04-05,"“…drivers in this dataset use Autopilot for 34.8% of their driven miles, and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance.”"

2019-04-05,Yes
2019-04-05,"Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars"
2019-04-05,That’s exactly the idea. What’s not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software & going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22.
2019-04-05,Thanks 
2019-04-05,Great work with Stripe btw. Much needed.
2019-04-05,I’m told it’s looking positive & we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas
2019-04-05,Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
2019-04-05,Impressive analysis
2019-04-05,"Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera."
2019-04-05,"Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows & rear window."
2019-04-05,"It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."

2019-04-04,"Yes, needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input."
2019-04-04,Great name 
2019-04-04,Neural net is upgraded too in this release. It’s not just a settings change.
2019-04-04,"Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup."
2019-04-04,Starhopper completed tethered hop. All systems green.
2019-04-04,Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car!
2019-04-03,This is way more awesome than it might sound
2019-04-03,Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower & allow below current “0%” level. Making that adjustment too.
2019-04-03,Agreed
2019-04-03,Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.
2019-04-03,Change your screen preference from night mode to auto

2019-03-30,Instagram comments are coding in emojis
2019-03-30,Also true
2019-03-30,True
2019-03-30,The quality of emojis varies wildly
2019-03-30,Lame
2019-03-30, 
2019-03-30,C++ syntax sucks
2019-03-30,"Assert (“Money” == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);"
2019-03-30,Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!
2019-03-30,Like the movie Us. Scary … but also empathetic.
2019-03-30,"No, but for sure the other way around!"
2019-03-30,"Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear, but you can feel in your chest"
2019-03-30,"We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot & fast, so dicey."
2019-03-30,"Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare."
2019-03-30,"Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year’s vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer & max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying."
2019-03-30,"Probably no fairing either & just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible."
2019-03-30,"Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2."
2019-03-30,Anyone who bought FSD will get it
2019-03-29,"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 & HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."
2019-03-29,Yes. Sensitive propulsion & avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
2019-03-29,"Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow."
2019-03-29,"We should send probes to outer solar system & get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there’s an alien artifact out there …"
2019-03-29,Super cool!
2019-03-29,Good point
2019-03-29,"Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate."
2019-03-28,"Rare use case, but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability."
2019-03-28,Exactly
2019-03-27,Super proud of Tesla Autopilot team!
2019-03-27,"No, it is one week either way."
2019-03-27, 
2019-03-26,"I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo."
2019-03-26,It would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon!
2019-03-26,"12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children’s toys?"
2019-03-26,That’s exactly it. You’re no longer mentally fatigued after a long drive. Makes a major difference to your happiness level commuting home from work after a long day.
2019-03-26,Good point
2019-03-26,Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it
2019-03-26,"Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained. Yes, but we’re going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads."
2019-03-26,Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon.

2019-03-17,"Yes, full duration"
2019-03-17,White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 Kelvin
2019-03-17,"Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium & carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint."
2019-03-17,Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment.
2019-03-17,No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps

2019-03-17,We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
2019-03-17,"You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump & combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber."
2019-03-17,"Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship & Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations."
2019-03-17,Agreed
2019-03-17,"Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed."
2019-03-17,"Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …"
2019-03-17,"Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine & stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely."
2019-03-17,First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.

2019-03-16,Yes!
2019-03-16,"Definitely down the road, once construction & upgrades aren’t so crazy"
2019-03-16,"This causes some media confusion, as batch builds & ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month & terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules."
2019-03-16,"Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations & we try to build in batches to simplify production"
2019-03-16,"Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer"
2019-03-16,"Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity."
2019-03-16,"Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions."
2019-03-16,"Still get this question a lot, even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice."

2019-03-12,"In retrospect, lower price shouldn’t have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn’t afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday."
2019-03-12,"However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak"
2019-03-12,"We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team & board."
2019-03-12,"When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don’t want to write Tesla a check. So it goes."
2019-03-12,Yes

2019-03-07,Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays & updated software with battery warmup results in >2X improvement in fleet charge time
2019-03-07,"We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues & then begin buildout worldwide."
2019-03-07,"Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case & more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput."
2019-03-07,"Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%."
2019-03-07,So true 
2019-03-07,Extremely important merch
2019-03-07,"Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (& rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm)"

2019-03-07,Ukraine did play a major role
2019-03-07,Very little power & only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won’t notice it in range.
2019-03-07,"If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power"
2019-03-07,Russia has excellent rocket engineering & best engine currently flying. Reusable version of their new Angara rocket would be great.

2019-03-03,"Yes. Personally, I’m most excited by the Tesla Truck. Maybe it will be too futuristic for most people, but I love it."
2019-03-03,"Yes, anyone will be able to take videos"
2019-03-03,I believe so
2019-03-03,"No, that unveil is later this year"
2019-03-03,Slightly higher drag * slightly higher frontal area affects air friction & mass affects rolling resistance & hill climb. Physics is the law.
2019-03-03,Normal
2019-03-03,Yes
2019-03-03,"Detailed specs & pricing will be provided, as well as test rides in Y"
2019-03-03,"Model Y, being an SUV, is about 10% bigger than Model 3, so will cost about 10% more & have slightly less range for same battery"
2019-03-03,Model Y unveil event on March 14 at LA Design Studio

2019-03-03,SpaceX Crew Dragon has docked with International @Space_Station
2019-03-03,"Yes, she would be able to breathe"
2019-03-03,Proximity docking sequence underway. Dragon shadow visible on on @Space_Station solar arrays.
2019-03-03,One day we will be there to see for ourselves

2019-03-03,I am not a dog. Here’s a pic of me:
2019-03-03,Model S will be raised to 162mph too
2019-03-03,Thank you. May you have good luck and godspeed with your spacecraft!
2019-03-03,"Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. Also, thank you to @NASA, without whom this would not be possible."
2019-03-02,Power will increase on all cars. Top speed on 3P increases to 162mph. Range on RWD 3 increases to 325 miles.
2019-03-02,"Yes, new cars and existing fleet"
2019-03-02,Firmware update coming later this month will increase power by ~5% & top speed by 10 km/h or 7mph
2019-03-02,Spoiler alert: not Porsche
2019-03-02,Thank you on behalf of the many people of SpaceX
2019-03-02,Lightning bolt right before launch
2019-03-02,Earth floats gently in zero gravity
2019-03-02,SpaceX Crew Dragon recap
2019-03-02,Need to get back to SpaceX launch control. Sorry this solution isn’t perfect.
2019-03-02,"We’re trying to make EVs & autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company."
2019-03-02,Will take a few days for system update
2019-03-02,"Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back."
2019-03-02,"It’s not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term"
2019-03-02,"If you bought enhanced autopilot, FSD upgrade costs $2k instead of $5k"
2019-03-02,"If you bought a Tesla before yesterday’s price reduction, you can have Autopilot or full self-driving at half normal cost (up to $6k less)"
2019-03-02,He is the sensor!
2019-03-02,"Nope, he’s going to float around in zero gravity"
2019-03-02,Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch!
2019-03-02,Happy birthday!
2019-03-01,"Yeah, just use a dryer outlet. High power, easy to install & low cost."
2019-03-01,Explanation from Tesla later today
2019-03-01,Yes
2019-03-01,Haha
2019-03-01,Ripley
2019-03-01,"Base Model 3 available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia 6 to 8 months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes & import duties mean price may be 25% or more above US number."
2019-03-01,Exactly
2019-03-01,No reductions from here
2019-03-01,For sure. It fundamentally improves quality of life.
2019-03-01,Best choice for most people is standard range plus with Autopilot
2019-03-01,Exact Tesla Model 3 in my profile pic costs $35k before incentives & takes 1 minute to buy online at
2019-02-28,I think we should do something here. Will talk with team & send out a note in next few days.
2019-02-28,Should be ~5% peak power increase with March 15 software release
2019-02-28,"Scheduled for March 15 release, along with many other improvements"
2019-02-28,"Everyone who bought Enhanced Autopilot will get Navigate on Autopilot on highways, advanced summon & autopark"

2019-02-27,Thursday 2pm
2019-02-26,"Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder."
2019-02-26,"Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
2019-02-26,"Yes, exciting potential"
2019-02-26,Exactly
2019-02-26,"Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet."
2019-02-26,Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
2019-02-26,"Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco & other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX’s success. Great respect & appreciation!"
2019-02-26,"Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
2019-02-26,"Indeed. I have great respect for judges. It’s not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."
2019-02-26,"SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing … "
2019-02-26,Oh hi lol
2019-02-25,"Fate *loves* irony. Frankly, too much."
2019-02-25,Meetings are a valuable use of time!

2019-02-23,http://stankmemes.com
2019-02-23,Respawn++
2019-02-22,Great meme review hosted by Will Smith
2019-02-22,Haha true
2019-02-22,It’s designed to be way better. We’ll see what reality has to say about that.
2019-02-22,"Yes, lot of risk"
2019-02-22,"Guys, I have feelings … "
2019-02-22,Focusing on Starship instead
2019-02-22,Deorbits & burns up over the Pacific
2019-02-22,"Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads & Dragon abort thrusters."
2019-02-22,"Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so"
2019-02-22,"Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."
2019-02-22,"High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
2019-02-22,Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
2019-02-22,Yes 
2019-02-22,Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April.
2019-02-21,Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
2019-02-21,"Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight."
2019-02-21,SN2 has changes that should help
2019-02-21,To the first part. I doubt we’d create a Dyson ring or sphere.
2019-02-21,Yes
2019-02-21,"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done."
2019-02-21,"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
2019-02-21,"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
2019-02-21,You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
2019-02-21,Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
2019-02-21,"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
2019-02-21,"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
2019-02-21,"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
2019-02-21,"That’s true Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there."
2019-02-21,"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
2019-02-21,Don’t know
2019-02-21,"SpaceX commercial launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years."
2019-02-21,"Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
2019-02-21,"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight & thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
2019-02-21,So true John Clarke 
2019-02-21,"Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure & temperature in oxygen preburner"
2019-02-21,Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
2019-02-21,"That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don’t have any crypto holdings."
2019-02-21,"I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes."
2019-02-20,"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k."
2019-02-20,Won’t be long before they do
2019-02-20,"Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019"
2019-02-20,4000 Tesla cars loading in SF for Europe
2019-02-19,The gritty truth …
2019-02-18,Did meme review last night with Justin Roiland from @RickandMorty
2019-02-18,Agreed. Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location.
2019-02-17,Pics are so clear in space!
2019-02-17,That last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like
2019-02-17,"Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI & I didn’t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up & it was just better to part ways on good terms."
2019-02-17,I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering & manufacturing problems at Tesla (especially) & SpaceX
2019-02-17,"To clarify, I’ve not been involved closely with OpenAI for over a year & don’t have mgmt or board oversight"

2019-02-16,SpaceX foundry casting Raptor engine manifold out of Inconel
2019-02-16,It will soon
2019-02-16,"Yes, Autopilot max speed is 5mph above speed limit off highway or 90mph on highway"
2019-02-15,
2019-02-15,Of course I still love you
2019-02-14,"This is in addition to existing Cabin Overheat Protection, which come on automatically at high temps to ensure any babies or pets in the car are safe"
2019-02-14,Yes 
2019-02-14,"It will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and then, if that looks good, speed up next week. We def need to add a “Request Latest Update” feature!"
2019-02-14,Updating …
2019-02-14,"Wow, 2013"
2019-02-14,CNBC - “Tesla Model 3 ranked most satisfying car”
2019-02-14,"True, that headline is not exactly going to win a Pulitzer for originality"
2019-02-14,"Probably a month or two. Sentry mode became top priority, so pushed that out a bit."
2019-02-14,"Some sites maintained an almost daily Tesla deathwatch 11 years ago, reporting with an awful delight. 4000 days later …"
2019-02-13,Tesla Model X first SUV to receive a perfect crash test rating https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-x-perfect-safety-crash-test-rating-2019-2?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=topbar&amp;utm_term=mobile&amp;referrer=twitter via @businessinsider
2019-02-13,Bet the other carmakers didn’t see that one coming haha
2019-02-13,"Yeah, but simpler. Needed for landing burn or engines will suck in a bubble."
2019-02-13,хаха офигенно
2019-02-13,"Starship & Super Heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version 1. Very important, as helium costs more than oxygen on Falcon, even though liquid oxygen is 2/3 vehicle mass & helium weighs basically nothing."
2019-02-13,"Luke, I am your farter."
2019-02-13,"Thanks Jack, Twitter rocks! "
2019-02-12,To air is human
2019-02-12,Agreed
2019-02-11,Sorry Had a vital mission in Norway Now I am back
2019-02-11,True
2019-02-11,"Moon first, Mars as soon as the planets align"
2019-02-11,On my bedside table
2019-02-11,A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
2019-02-11,"Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress & setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!"
2019-02-11,The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
2019-02-11,At least 10X cheaper
2019-02-11,"Very dependent on volume, but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k & maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth & move to Mars if they want."
2019-02-11,Yes
2019-02-11,"This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
2019-02-11,Close
2019-02-11,"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
2019-02-11,Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
2019-02-11,"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
2019-02-11,"Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky."
2019-02-11,I think 6 where we lit main chamber & several with only preburners
2019-02-11,About 11 secs
2019-02-11,Definitely! It’s amazing that the RD-170 & RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
2019-02-11,"Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by @SpaceX engine/test team!"
2019-02-10,I was simply too sexy for it
2019-02-09,Maybe tomorrow
2019-02-09,"Just left Zeebrugge, now Tilburg, then Tesla HQ in Amsterdam & Oslo tonight to review service in Norway. Exciting to see thousands of Model 3’s on their way to owners in Europe!"
2019-02-09,Hope they don’t find this pic!

2019-02-08,I want you too baby
2019-02-08,Joe Rogan describes Tesla for 4 mins & 20 secs
2019-02-08,"Booster center of mass is much lower & more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry"
2019-02-08,"Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
2019-02-08,"Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
2019-02-07,Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
2019-02-07,"Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles."
2019-02-07,"The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just “Starship” & sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy"
2019-02-07, SpaceX Engineering 
2019-02-07,Telekinesis
2019-02-07,Vaporized some copper
2019-02-07,Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week
2019-02-07,"Design requires at least 170 metric tons of force. Engine reached 172 mT & 257 bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means 10% to 20% more with deep cryo."
2019-02-07,Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship & Super Heavy
2019-02-06,"Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow."
2019-02-06,
2019-02-06,We’re doing everything we can to get there. It’s a super hard grind.
2019-02-06,"Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other & lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, it’s way better."
2019-02-06,VAT of ~20% & import duties of ~10% usually result in a 30% higher cost in Europe

2019-02-04,Spark plugs ignite dual blow torches that ignite preburners & main chamber
2019-02-04,"Gaseous CH4/O2 & heavy duty spark plugs. Basically, a of insane power "
2019-02-04,"Will do, although SpaceX reddit is very well-informed. Really impressive analysis by some commenters."
2019-02-04,Engine use methox torch igniters. Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber.

2019-02-04,First firing of Starship Raptor flight engine! So proud of great work by @SpaceX team!!
2019-02-03,We will when it rolls out
2019-02-03,Yes
2019-02-03,At @SpaceX Texas with engineering team getting ready to fire new Raptor rocket engine
2019-02-03,soon
2019-02-03,Only a matter of time
2019-02-03,That might be the ultimate superpower
2019-02-03,How Model 3 performs on a long road trip
2019-02-02,"I’m openly moderate. There, I said it."
2019-02-02,Haha how is this even real?
2019-02-02,"No, payload will actually increase"
2019-02-02,Exactly
2019-02-02,I do like nonsense memes. It’s true.
2019-02-02,Yes
2019-02-02,
2019-02-02,Next few days

2019-02-01,Dammit! 
2019-02-01,"We’ll tweak the alloy over time, so it won’t exactly be 301, but close"
2019-02-01,"Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart"
2019-02-01,"Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher & doesn’t even need paint!"
2019-02-01,Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
2019-02-01,Mostly true
2019-02-01,"Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps & main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
2019-02-01,Yes
2019-02-01,Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship & booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) & sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
2019-02-01,Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas
2019-02-01,Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
2019-02-01,"To be clear, I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature & reduced need for heat shielding"
2019-02-01,"Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9"
2019-02-01,"Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime & angle of attack"
2019-01-31,Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
2019-01-31,And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar

2019-01-27,Tesla Sentry Mode will play Bach’s Toccata and Fugue during a robbery (and keep Summer safe)
2019-01-26,"All doors unlock automatically when the Tesla comes to a stop after an accident. There is both primary & backup power to doors, brakes, steering & airbags."
2019-01-25,Cool that this is happening on many fronts. Looks like a good design by @Boeing.
2019-01-25,"Yeah, worked on my cousin’s farm for six weeks around my 18th birthday. I was so kewl."
2019-01-25,Many cold weather improvements coming via OTA software

2019-01-23,Actual tanks are fine
2019-01-23,"~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel."
2019-01-23,I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night & fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
2019-01-23,"310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp"
2019-01-22,Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
2019-01-22,"Since it’s part of safety & security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it"
2019-01-22,Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
2019-01-22,"Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze & block cooling channels."
2019-01-22,Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings & signs in each country.
2019-01-22,"When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water"

2019-01-19,Yup
2019-01-18,"Thanks, good idea!"
2019-01-17,"Yes, ending on Feb 1. It’s adding too much cost to the cars, especially Model 3."
2019-01-17,Order must occur before Feb 1
2019-01-17,"No, the whole referral incentive system will end"
2019-01-17,"The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb 1. If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla & give them 6 months of free Supercharging, please do so before then."
2019-01-17,I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.
2019-01-17,"Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters, but it’s not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings"
2019-01-17,How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
2019-01-16,"Teslarati is very thoughtful & well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX"
2019-01-16,"The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX & Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication"
2019-01-16,"The source info is incorrect. Starship & Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport."
2019-01-16,Haha you’re welcome! Hope you’re doing well.

2019-01-09,Good idea
2019-01-09,It’s an option
2019-01-09,Vertically or horizontally?
2019-01-09,No problem
2019-01-09,"Plus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance"
2019-01-09,I don’t think the law fully anticipated this situation. So probably yes for a while.
2019-01-09,I’m not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear seats.

2018-12-27,2020
2018-12-27,Yes
2018-12-27,I will provide a detailed explanation in March/April
2018-12-27,Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better.
2018-12-27,Exactly
2018-12-27,Yes
2018-12-27,Probability at 60% & rising rapidly due to new architecture
2018-12-27,30%

2018-12-27,Yes
2018-12-27,Got it 
2018-12-26,"Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville & across Mexico."
2018-12-26,Yep
2018-12-26,Yes
2018-12-26,"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey."
2018-12-26,"Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
2018-12-26,We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities & working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
2018-12-26,Ok
2018-12-26,Wow!
2018-12-26,"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
2018-12-26,"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electric_cars_currently_available"
2018-12-26,"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
2018-12-26,"There are also many state & local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities & access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc"

2018-12-24,When it’s no longer noticeable over Planck’s length
2018-12-23,Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
2018-12-23,At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas
2018-12-23,Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.

2018-12-23,Yezzz
2018-12-23,How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
2018-12-23,Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities …
2018-12-23,Please put “invented car fart” on my gravestone. This is my only request.
2018-12-23,Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
2018-12-23,"SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."
2018-12-23,Thanks!
2018-12-22,"It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
2018-12-22,"You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo."
2018-12-22,"Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level."
2018-12-22,Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
2018-12-22,"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."
2018-12-22,"Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word “star” or “link” "
2018-12-22,"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster & orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well & thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons & Mars."
2018-12-22,Coldformed at cryo
2018-12-22,"This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height & diameter."
2018-12-22,We’re building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
2018-12-22,Exactly
2018-12-22,"For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry."
2018-12-22,Yes
2018-12-22,"I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
2018-12-22,"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel & we’re using a different alloy mix. I super 300 Series Stainless!"
2018-12-22,"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
2018-12-22,"Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys & new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
2018-12-22,"If Tesla committed delivery & customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"

2018-12-19,Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
2018-12-19,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
2018-12-19,Exactly
2018-12-19,"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber & a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
2018-12-19,"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
2018-12-19,"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp & elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
2018-12-19,"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators & I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
2018-12-19,"You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear."
2018-12-19,"Pop up, park and walk!"
2018-12-19,I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.

2018-12-19,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated & belted for high speed safety."
2018-12-19,Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
2018-12-19,Precisely
2018-12-19,Presentation starting at 8:15
2018-12-19,"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
2018-12-19,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination & then drives on normal roads back to start"
2018-12-19,"Actually way more capacity, way faster & way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better."
2018-12-19,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians & cyclists
2018-12-19,"Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
2018-12-19,Yes
2018-12-19,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
2018-12-19,Tesla in @boringcompany tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again
2018-12-18,Boring product launch will be streamed live at 8pm California time tonight
2018-12-18,Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
2018-12-18,Same applies to those who didn’t order PUP
2018-12-18,Exactly. It’s a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
2018-12-18,"Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago!"
2018-12-18,"Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers & cell phones. It takes many design iterations & vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability."
2018-12-18,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX & Tesla!
2018-12-18,Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiel’s Founder’s Fund: “we have no concerns whatsoever.”
2018-12-17,"Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting"
2018-12-16,‘Tis
2018-12-16,Medieval Futurism
2018-12-16,Tesla app almost done. Important to get every note right!
2018-12-16,Thanks!
2018-12-15,The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats & just wipe it off.
2018-12-15,Congratulations!
2018-12-15,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in 2 weeks, even if you haven’t placed an order yet"
2018-12-15,You got it
2018-12-15,Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build & interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
2018-12-15,
2018-12-14, 
2018-12-14,Zero Suit 
2018-12-14,God Fire
2018-12-14, ramen is sooo good 
2018-12-14,Exactly 
2018-12-13,This part is true. I was trying to explain that we don’t want our cars to have a “tinny” sound.
2018-12-12,You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
2018-12-11,Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though 
2018-12-11,"Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”."
2018-12-11,About 10 to 14 days
2018-12-11,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
2018-12-11,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at http://Tesla.com or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
2018-12-11,No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
2018-12-11,I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
2018-12-11,Yes
2018-12-11,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be."
2018-12-11,Probably next month
2018-12-11,You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.
2018-12-11,"We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
2018-12-11,Probably end of next year
2018-12-11,So true 
2018-12-11,This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
2018-12-11,"60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party."
2018-12-09,We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
2018-12-09,"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability."
2018-12-09,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs & roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
2018-12-09,"If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars & takes highway interchanges & off-ramps."
2018-12-09,Machete!!
2018-12-09,"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
2018-12-09,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later."
2018-12-09,"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe & later China."
2018-12-09,"Buying http://Tesla.com took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn’t like http://teslamotors.com even when we were only making ."
2018-12-09,"Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
2018-12-09,"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
2018-12-09,But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
2018-12-09,Yes
2018-12-09,Interesting
2018-12-09,"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
2018-12-09,The new design is metal
2018-12-08,"As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint."
2018-12-07,Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars & ground to tunnel car elevators.
2018-12-05,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
2018-12-05,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
2018-12-05,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump & lines."
2018-12-05,We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
2018-12-05,"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
2018-12-05,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged & is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
2018-12-05,Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes
2018-12-04,Us too sigh
2018-12-03,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out & launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
2018-12-03,64 satellites on this flight!
2018-12-03,"We’re adding police car, fire truck & ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
2018-12-03,"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop & turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
2018-12-02,It is so hard to move in armor!
2018-12-02,You’re all hired!
2018-12-02,Yes … no … maybe …
2018-12-02,None shall pass!
2018-12-01,Ok
2018-12-01,Good advice
2018-12-01,Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
2018-12-01,Glad you’re ok
2018-12-01,"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
2018-12-01,"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
2018-12-01,"Incoming rocket & fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
2018-12-01,You got it!
2018-12-01,"Three things, one of which is CH4"
2018-12-01,No
2018-12-01,No
2018-12-01,"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Can’t wipe it off."
2018-12-01,Haha
2018-12-01,"Prof Dahn is correct (he’s great), but the relative benefit is small. I’d recommend 10% more SoC for convenience."
2018-12-01,"Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also, no issue going to 5% or lower SoC."
2018-12-01,True 
2018-12-01, 
2018-11-30,Both
2018-11-30,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time
2018-11-30,One day
2018-11-30,"We’re doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but we’re just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
2018-11-30,Update soon
2018-11-29,Sorry 
2018-11-29,Boring breakthrough @BoringCompany
2018-11-29,Definitely
2018-11-29,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
2018-11-29,We tried. Nintendo won’t license it to us.
2018-11-29,That would be cool
2018-11-29,Haha kinda true 
2018-11-29,Never heard of it
2018-11-29,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor & more video games."
2018-11-29,Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
2018-11-29,Yes
2018-11-29,"This is completely backwards. Based on what we’ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won’t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
2018-11-29,"You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent."
2018-11-28,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
2018-11-28,Tiny wizard 
2018-11-27,7 to 10 years
2018-11-27,"Engineers, artists & creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
2018-11-27,Touché
2018-11-27,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work"
2018-11-26,"Varies per person, but about 80 sustained, peaking above 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80."
2018-11-26,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week"
2018-11-26,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then @SpaceX, @Tesla, @BoringCompany &amp; @Neuralink are the places to be."
2018-11-26,Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
2018-11-26, 
2018-11-26,1000 liters of pure water costs $1
2018-11-26,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs 0.1 cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
2018-11-26,Ah yes fair point
2018-11-26,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
2018-11-26,Not yet
2018-11-26, trouble
2018-11-26,Earth is
2018-11-26,"Earth’s crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava"
2018-11-26,"Earth should be called Water. Our surface is 71% water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as it’s all land. Even when warmed up & water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about 2/3 land."
2018-11-26,"Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
2018-11-25,"Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks & heatshield"
2018-11-23,"If you don’t want a Tesla, here’s a list of all electric cars in North America https://cleantechnica.com/2018/01/07/electric-vehicles-for-sale-usa/ via @cleantechnica"

2018-11-21,Happy Thanksgiving!!
2018-11-21, Starships were meant to fly 
2018-11-21,Starship Tooters
2018-11-21,Good one
2018-11-21,Good idea
2018-11-21,Coming soon
2018-11-21,Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
2018-11-21,Should be next week
2018-11-20,"No, it’s the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon 9"
2018-11-20,Later versions will
2018-11-20,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage & Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
2018-11-20,Renaming BFR to Starship
2018-11-20,"No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR"
2018-11-20,Yes
2018-11-19,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
2018-11-19,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
2018-11-19,"No, it’s got enough load capacity & volume to carry the battery pack & our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."
2018-11-19,"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts & processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
2018-11-19,"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
2018-11-19,"Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler & produce sooner or do all & produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
2018-11-19,Ok
2018-11-19,Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
2018-11-19,Absolutely agree
2018-11-19,Investigating
2018-11-19,Probably mid 2019
2018-11-19,Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
2018-11-19,"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
2018-11-19,Should be possible. Please ask service & lmk response.
2018-11-19,"No, but perhaps in a few years"
2018-11-19,"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
2018-11-19,"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
2018-11-19,Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
2018-11-19,Will allow having your car picked up & dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
2018-11-19,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
2018-11-17,"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA & USAF are supportive."
2018-11-17,Radical change
2018-11-17,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
2018-11-17,It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
2018-11-17,"Set air flow to recirculating mode & manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
2018-11-17,Congratulations @BoringCompany on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
2018-11-17,
2018-11-17,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!
2018-11-17,Missed miku concert sigh
2018-11-17,Listening to Better Now
2018-11-16,"China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation & transport"
2018-11-16,"Sure hope this isn’t true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict."
2018-11-16,Haha

2018-11-15,Fortnite irl
2018-11-15,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks & a picture.
2018-11-15,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
2018-11-15,Not much but it is ours
2018-11-15,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks & we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
2018-11-15,"We have to truck to departure rail head & truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too & trains don’t leave often."
2018-11-15,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
2018-11-15,Yes
2018-11-15,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe & Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
2018-11-15,We bought some trucking companies & secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
2018-11-15,Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
2018-11-15,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload & direct to owner location."
2018-11-15,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30
2018-11-14,We will fight Big Tequila!

2018-11-14,"Congratulations @SpaceX team! Thanks @NASA, much appreciated."
2018-11-12,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination & delight you created for humanity will last forever."
2018-11-12,Is he ok?
2018-11-11,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
2018-11-11,Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
2018-11-10,"Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms & partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
2018-11-10,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
2018-11-10,"That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
2018-11-10,"We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …"
2018-11-10,Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
2018-11-10,"Good, but not hospital grade. S & X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid & alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3."
2018-11-10,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S & X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
2018-11-09,"Fair point, will reenable"
2018-11-09,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
2018-11-09,Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
2018-11-09,Cool
2018-11-09,"With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
2018-11-09,Yes
2018-11-08,Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
2018-11-07,"No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
2018-11-07,Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield & high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
2018-11-07,Aiming for orbital flight by June
2018-11-07,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship

2018-11-03,"Yes, Germany has outstanding engineering talent"
2018-11-03,"Just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating & decelerating"
2018-11-03,
2018-11-03,So underappreciated
2018-11-03,Ok
2018-11-03,Ok
2018-11-03,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.
2018-11-03,"Sounds like pure luxury! When I said ‘sponge’, I was actually speaking metaphorically. Truth is, I was just a simple nucleotide, drifting alone in small crevice with 3 trillion siblings."
2018-11-03,What is love?
2018-11-03,Bikini Bottom
2018-11-03,Fair
2018-11-03,"Yes, that is how"
2018-11-03,We didn’t even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
2018-11-03,Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
2018-11-03,Wow that’s cool!
2018-11-03,Kids these days have it easy
2018-11-03,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
2018-11-03,Haha
2018-11-03,First movie I ever saw in theaters
2018-11-03,When the only existing life was a sponge
2018-11-03,Although it was in the precambrian era
2018-11-03,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.

2018-11-03,Yes
2018-11-02,Definitely
2018-11-02,"Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation"
2018-11-02,"Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa & South America end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020"
2018-11-02,"Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China & Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
2018-11-02,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
2018-11-02,"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules & packs at China Giga, as we do today in California & Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
2018-11-02,"Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
2018-11-02,Prob 2 to 3 weeks

2018-11-01,
2018-11-01,We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
2018-11-01,Hahaha 
2018-11-01,Um yes
2018-11-01,"Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon & say who’s the pet now …"
2018-11-01,"Also, you’ll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight"
2018-11-01,Car will drive to your phone location & follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app
2018-11-01,"Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past 2 years (Autopilot hardware V2+)."
2018-10-31,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
2018-10-31,"For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm it’s valid & park."
2018-10-31,Cool haha
2018-10-29,"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer & secretary. Guess I have to keep 1st one or it will confuse the authorities."
2018-10-29,"Good point, might put that one back"
2018-10-29,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. I’m now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
2018-10-27,Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
2018-10-27,"Don’t worry, we’ll make it right"
2018-10-27,The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
2018-10-27,Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
2018-10-27,"It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action …"
2018-10-27,"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?"
2018-10-27,We will enable track mode for all performance cars
2018-10-27,"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund & free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
2018-10-27,"Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
2018-10-27,"Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
2018-10-27,Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
2018-10-27,Exactly. That’s Monday.
2018-10-27,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
2018-10-27,"No, but I will"
2018-10-27,Isn’t it obvious?
2018-10-27,Worth it
2018-10-27,True
2018-10-27,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
2018-10-27,"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
2018-10-27,Haha
2018-10-27,"On Insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get 1%."
2018-10-27,Lacks scale
2018-10-27,"Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
2018-10-27,"Reddit’s twitter account is lame, because it’s not real Reddit"
2018-10-27,Exactly
2018-10-27,You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
2018-10-27,"On Twitter, likes are rare & criticism is brutal. So hardcore. It’s great."
2018-10-26,Glad you’re ok @tylerthecreator
2018-10-26,"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model 3, so bikes can fit in trunk"
2018-10-26,Hey that’s my Halloween costume!
2018-10-26,Good question
2018-10-26,"Clearly, you’re not reading my twitter"
2018-10-26,I wish

2018-10-25, in 
2018-10-25,Fresh puro from my meme dealer
2018-10-25,Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
2018-10-25,"Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements & no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone."
2018-10-25,Massive thanks to Tesla owners & supporters. We wouldn’t be here without you.
2018-10-25,Same
2018-10-25,2025
2018-10-25,How’d they know!?
2018-10-25,Around mid 2019
2018-10-23,"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit & finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
2018-10-23,Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
2018-10-23,Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn’t look like a radiator grill opening.
2018-10-23,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
2018-10-23,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S & X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."
2018-10-23,"Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
2018-10-23,Working on it
2018-10-23,That is correct

2018-10-22,I think real
2018-10-22,Opens Dec 10

2018-10-19,I hope this is true!
2018-10-19,"If you don’t like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
2018-10-18,Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
2018-10-18,"Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
2018-10-18,"It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
2018-10-18,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow & ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires."
2018-10-18,"It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
2018-10-18,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model 3 & super simple new order page"

2018-10-17,Yes 
2018-10-17,New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
2018-10-17,"Yes, aiming for next few months"
2018-10-17,"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months & all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
2018-10-17,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
2018-10-17,Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America & realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
2018-10-16,Insightful article by David @Pogue
2018-10-16,"Thanks John, really admire you too! I think you’re one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
2018-10-16,The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
2018-10-16,I believe it’s $5k
2018-10-16,~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
2018-10-16,Somewhere between 500% & 2000%
2018-10-16,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU & better use of discrete GPU."
2018-10-15,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
2018-10-15,Still a long way to go
2018-10-15,Model 3 motor & gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.
2018-10-15,Works best if you play games full screen & use steering wheel scroller balls for control

2018-10-12,You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Don’t have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
2018-10-12,Yes
2018-10-12,"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you."

2018-10-12,Beautiful picture
2018-10-11,"Yes, it’s hard to find. Not sure why."
2018-10-11,"Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSA’s *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
2018-10-10,This is incorrect

2018-10-09,We’d be nothing without our fans
2018-10-09,Because 11 is obviously louder than 10 
2018-10-09,No such thing as a “full refresh” at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
2018-10-09,It sure does. Very reliable.

2018-10-05,Fair point 
2018-10-05,"When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
2018-10-05,"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds & small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."
2018-10-05,V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.

2018-10-05,"The big funds can & will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking."
2018-10-05,"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively & consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market & without clear consent of the shareholder"
2018-10-05,"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors & retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
2018-10-05,"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base & gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
2018-10-05,I hope to be less wrong over time
2018-10-05,You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
2018-10-04,What they do should be illegal
2018-10-04,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
2018-10-04,Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.

2018-09-28,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
2018-09-28,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
2018-09-26,Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
2018-09-26,You’re welcome. Sorry for the delay!
2018-09-26,What would be great is original Elite
2018-09-25,Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
2018-09-25, Tesla Owners 
2018-09-25,"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
2018-09-25, 
2018-09-24,"Apologies, we’re upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
2018-09-24,Tricky one
2018-09-22,"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun & morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
2018-09-21,Probably 2028 for a base to be built
2018-09-21,Mars Base Alpha
2018-09-21,
2018-09-20,"Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
2018-09-20,"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear & still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
2018-09-20,Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia & other important car terms at https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/03/25-car-terms-you-need-to-know/polar-moment-of-inertia
2018-09-20,"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling & driving feel. Extremely important metric."
2018-09-20,A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
2018-09-20,"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
2018-09-20,"Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
2018-09-20,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
2018-09-20,"Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."
2018-09-20,Haha true
2018-09-20,.@NHTSAgov will post final safety probability stats soon. Model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
2018-09-20, 
2018-09-20,"Wow, glad they’re ok!"
2018-09-20,Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
2018-09-19, @neiltyson
2018-09-19,Tesla Rangers!
2018-09-19,"31 engines, but with room to add 11 more down the road. Kinda have to."
2018-09-19,"Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldn’t spend computing power on sound"
2018-09-19,Yes
2018-09-19,True 
2018-09-19,"To conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed"
2018-09-19,You’re most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
2018-09-18,Will do. Love Reddit.
2018-09-18,Space Bar
2018-09-18,"Long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions & anyone will be able to go"
2018-09-18,"Yeah, Starlink should be active by then"
2018-09-18,Sorry! So many bots!!
2018-09-18,"Moon mission will be livestreamed in high def VR, so it’ll feel like you’re there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light"
2018-09-18,Perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to play. There will be no obligation to do so.

2018-09-18,Always
2018-09-18,Yes
2018-09-18,That’s the first BFR airframe/tank barrel section made of a new carbon fiber material
2018-09-18,"Yeah … that’s exactly how I feel. However it happens, I just hope it does."
2018-09-18,Thanks for helping fund a rocket & spaceship that could take humanity beyond Earth!
2018-09-18,Hanging out with @yousuck2020 before the @SpaceX moon mission announcement
2018-09-18,Yusaku will be bringing 8 (brave) artists & cultural figures with him on the journey around the moon!
2018-09-17,Probably V10 alpha build
2018-09-17,"Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1."
2018-09-17,Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied & this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
2018-09-17,Thank you for your trust in the @SpaceX team. Greatly appreciated.
2018-09-17,Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
2018-09-17,Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. It’s not sustainable long-term.
2018-09-17,Very interesting
2018-09-17,"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night"
2018-09-17,This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?
2018-09-17,"Yes, I do"
2018-09-17,Top SpaceX priority is and will remain supporting @NASA crewed spaceflight and National Security missions
2018-09-17,"Btw, can’t emphasize enough how @SpaceX would not be where it is today without @NASA. Thank you."
2018-09-17,With lasers
2018-09-17,My fav tweet ever
2018-09-17,"@ummjackson if you can help get rid of the annoying scam spammers, that would be much appreciated"
2018-09-17,Ok

2018-09-17,"Sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We’re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly."
2018-09-17,Awesome 
2018-09-17,"Design has been changed so the lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three fins, two of which actuate (mostly for pitch control)"
2018-09-17,"Sorry, it’s not really sustainable at volume production & doesn’t incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier."
2018-09-16,Yes
2018-09-16,"Yeah, that’s our problem. Service & parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks."
2018-09-16,"Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting 1000’s of makes & models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock & not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference."
2018-09-16,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
2018-09-16,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
2018-09-16,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"
2018-09-15,True
2018-09-15,"Tesla owners can grant free Supercharging for life to a friend who buys S/3/X. Ends tomorrow night. http://tesla.com/support/referral-program"""

2018-09-12,Thoughtful feedback
2018-09-12,"Due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in North America, Tesla customers may experience longer response times. Resolving this is our top priority."
2018-09-12,"My apologies, am working on this exact issue right now"
2018-09-11,Best show in the multiverse!
2018-09-11,"No, service will stock all colors"
2018-09-11,"Love that red. We tried every possible way to make red look 3D without floating a special red tint in primary gloss layer, but no way. We have to stop whole paint shop for red & it looks like an episode of Dexter."
2018-09-11,"Moving 2 of 7 Tesla colors off menu on Wednesday to simplify manufacturing. Obsidian Black & Metallic Silver will still be available as special request, but at higher price."

2018-09-03,"Much appreciated! Great word-of-mouth is why Model 3 is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements."
2018-08-31,"The multi-coat colors (pearl white & red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth & complexity"
2018-08-31,"Sorry, we’ve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint & quality in general. If need be, we’re repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done."
2018-08-31,Can Steve Bannon please insult me some more? Best PR I’ve had in a while.

2018-08-28,V cool
2018-08-28,So you actually did nothing & yet imply you are a truth-seeker. The Twitter name you chose is @yoda.
2018-08-28,"Answer the question @yoda. You brought it up, not me. Did you investigate or not? If so, what did you actually do?"
2018-08-28,"At this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam"
2018-08-28,Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?

2018-08-25,This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
2018-08-25,"Most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks & other service costs."
2018-08-25,"Most major customers have tried it & love it. Now we need to finish production design & build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time …"
2018-08-25,Maybe …
2018-08-25,"This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn’t make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors."

2018-08-07,Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.
2018-08-07,Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
2018-08-07,"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)"
2018-08-07,No change
2018-08-07,Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private
2018-08-07,Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
2018-08-07,My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.
2018-08-07,Yes
2018-08-07,I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.

2018-07-15,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
2018-07-15,"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
2018-07-14,So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
2018-07-14,"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent & politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me & I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone."

2018-07-11,This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
2018-07-11,I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
2018-07-11,Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.

2018-07-07,I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
2018-07-07,"Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
2018-07-07,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
2018-07-07,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
2018-07-07,Ground winds would
2018-07-07,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
2018-07-07,Can’t be too buoyant
2018-07-07,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
2018-07-06,Good idea
2018-07-06,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack."
2018-07-06,You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 
2018-07-06,"Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
2018-07-06,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.
2018-07-06,It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
2018-07-06,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
2018-07-06,I would def recommend this
2018-07-06,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
2018-07-06,Interesting
2018-07-06,"Great, thanks"
2018-07-06,Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
2018-07-06,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won’t come in"
2018-07-06,"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
2018-07-06,SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
2018-07-06,"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
2018-07-06,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
2018-07-06,Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
2018-07-06,"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
2018-07-06,Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
2018-07-05,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for & parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
2018-07-05,"I know you & believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"

2018-07-05,They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
2018-07-05,Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
2018-07-05,Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
2018-07-05,
2018-07-05,.@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective
2018-07-05,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
2018-07-05,Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette &amp; supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
2018-07-05,Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
2018-07-05,True
2018-07-05,"So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism."
2018-07-05,".@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
2018-07-05,What a coincidence …
2018-07-05,Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
2018-07-05,"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
2018-07-05,"Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
2018-07-05,"Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion."
2018-07-05,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
2018-07-05,"Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
2018-07-05,"@lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."
2018-07-05,"Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters."
2018-07-05,".@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
2018-07-05,".@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

2018-06-25,Important to read the Wash Post article. The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.

2018-06-25,True
2018-06-25,"We should always be concerned about the welfare of children & those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan & often inaccurate"
2018-06-25,"“… of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”"
2018-06-25,"“All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”"

2018-06-17,"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
2018-06-17,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
2018-06-17,How big is your short position? Just curious.
2018-06-17,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
2018-06-17,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."

2018-05-30,"Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort."
2018-05-30,"Yeah, absolutely"
2018-05-30,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.

2018-05-27,You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.
2018-05-27,"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
2018-05-27,"Yup, deleted"

2018-05-27,"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking & will ride tire traction limit. You won’t notice sport brakes unless you’re on a racetrack & have the sticky 20” tires."
2018-05-27,"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model 3 started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks @ConsumerReports for excellent critical feedback!"
2018-05-27,"Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers & sport level brakes"

2018-05-26,So true 
2018-05-26,Because Twitter is fun
2018-05-26,USAToday FTW!
2018-05-26,Dank is wack unless you’re on weed
2018-05-26,"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this “non-journalist” who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"
2018-05-26,But femtotech is the future … https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtotechnology
2018-05-26,Nanotech is so 2008. Picotech is 1000 times better.
2018-05-26,"Yeah, that’s exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought."
2018-05-26,The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
2018-05-26,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that “dumb” public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...
2018-05-26,A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.
2018-05-26,"Pretty good. TinTin A & B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."

2018-05-26,The pain will end
2018-05-26,"Wow, amazing Tesla hypermile drive happening"
2018-05-26,Gwynne has been prez of SpaceX for 10 years & well-deserved
2018-05-26,"Stop trying to charm me. It won’t work. Ok, maybe a little Are you a real person or a bot?"
2018-05-26,"Using “rocket science” non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on "
2018-05-26,What are you talking about? You’re being incredibly rude & nonsensical.
2018-05-26,"Wow, haven’t watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
2018-05-26,"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
2018-05-26,Can’t believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!
2018-05-26,"We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles"
2018-05-26,Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
2018-05-26,Prob end of next year
2018-05-26,"Good point, we will add that to the construction plan"
2018-05-26,"Global map of Tesla Superchargers, including those coming soon"
2018-05-25,"Earth’s rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower"
2018-05-25,You’re making my point. It’s tragic that there’s a national nano day. I wish I didn’t know that.
2018-05-25,All four. Zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
2018-05-25,Model 3 was designed for min engineering & tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe & Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
2018-05-25,This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
2018-05-25,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
2018-05-25,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year & is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out."
2018-05-25,Worth a shot
2018-05-25,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …
2018-05-25,"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
2018-05-25,"Problem solved, was able to buy http://Pravduh.com! Game on …"
2018-05-25,"I know, I know. Russia seriously didn’t correct me on this!"
2018-05-25,"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd …"
2018-05-25,"Turns out http://Pravda.com is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
2018-05-25,"For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
2018-05-25,"Tried to buy http://Pravda.com, but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
2018-05-25,"Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles & know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
2018-05-25,I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest & yet believe that same public is too stupid & immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
2018-05-25,The Tesla facility is open plan & we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well & they are some of the worst & best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
2018-05-25,No
2018-05-25,Nano applies to everything & therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry. http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Nanotechnology
2018-05-24,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
2018-05-24,"Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law & land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
2018-05-24,Done
2018-05-24,Have a confirmed real name identity section & an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
2018-05-24,Be careful what you wish for
2018-05-24,"Amazingly, the “media is awesome” vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll "
2018-05-24,My point exactly
2018-05-24,"Ahem, you have “nano” in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs."
2018-05-24,Reddit is great
2018-05-24,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
2018-05-24,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
2018-05-24,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
2018-05-24,I did to any who asked
2018-05-24,"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product & it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
2018-05-24,"Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like & what needs to be improved"
2018-05-24,"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right."
2018-05-24,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
2018-05-24,Gasoline or diesel?
2018-05-24,What car do you drive?
2018-05-24,March 15
2018-05-24,The media
2018-05-24,"Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now, I’m cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
2018-05-24,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called “You’re Right!” I do actually own http://youreright.com, but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
2018-05-24,Definitely
2018-05-24,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these and this is the best one "
2018-05-24,Yo
2018-05-24,That’s the basic idea
2018-05-24,"For some reason, this is the best I’ve felt in a while. Hope you’re feeling good too "
2018-05-24,"I just tried to donate, but you don’t accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
2018-05-23,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
2018-05-23,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious …
2018-05-23,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
2018-05-23,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
2018-05-23,"If you’re in media & don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …"
2018-05-23, 
2018-05-23,"I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
2018-05-23,Of course
2018-05-23,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company."
2018-05-23,"No, they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
2018-05-23,Will do
2018-05-23,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
2018-05-23,That’s why editors are included too
2018-05-23,We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
2018-05-23,"Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves."
2018-05-23,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
2018-05-23,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
2018-05-23,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek & unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
2018-05-23,Exactly
2018-05-23,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …"
2018-05-23,An exception that proves the rule
2018-05-23,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
2018-05-23,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
2018-05-23,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
2018-05-23,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
2018-05-23,"Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
2018-05-23,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
2018-05-23,"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis & Oblivion"
2018-05-23,I am not cool
2018-05-23,The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
2018-05-23,"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so I’m glad there’s some good too . Her music is incredible."
2018-05-23,Thanks. Not super fun right now 
2018-05-23,Busted 
2018-05-23,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together & messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
2018-05-23,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics & backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
2018-05-22,Great idea!
2018-05-22,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
2018-05-22,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
2018-05-22,Interesting he stops at ‘09. That’s when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
2018-05-22,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 
2018-05-22,"But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote & find out."
2018-05-22,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it."
2018-05-22,"We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
2018-05-22,Good point
2018-05-22,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class “lords & commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers & workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
2018-05-22,"More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article …"
2018-05-22,No problem
2018-05-22,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
2018-05-22,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
2018-05-22,I didn’t meet with him
2018-05-22,I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
2018-05-22,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
2018-05-22,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
2018-05-22,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
2018-05-22,"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production."
2018-05-22,ABS calibration algorithm
2018-05-22,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
2018-05-22,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
2018-05-22,"Stop, you’re making me blush "
2018-05-22,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
2018-05-22,Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
2018-05-22,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
2018-05-22,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this."
2018-05-22,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
2018-05-22,"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
2018-05-21,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."
2018-05-21,Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
2018-05-21, 
2018-05-21,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
2018-05-21,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
2018-05-21,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal."

2018-05-21,SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to @NASA Plum Brook vacuum chamber
2018-05-21,For sure before snowfall this year
2018-05-21,It can tow far more than rated capacity
2018-05-21,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
2018-05-21,"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live."
2018-05-21,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
2018-05-21,Exactly ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
2018-05-21,"Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union."
2018-05-21,"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it."
2018-05-20,Yes
2018-05-20,Exactly
2018-05-20,They can form a union whenever they want & there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
2018-05-20,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
2018-05-20,"They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
2018-05-20,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell"
2018-05-20,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
2018-05-20,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
2018-05-20,Good idea ...
2018-05-20,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
2018-05-20,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
2018-05-20,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
2018-05-20,Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
2018-05-20,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
2018-05-20,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
2018-05-20,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec 0-60mph 155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range"
2018-05-20,"It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
2018-05-20,Exactly
2018-05-20,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.
2018-05-20,I’m about to test the configurator & then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
2018-05-20,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
2018-05-20,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
2018-05-20,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black & white interior."
2018-05-20,"AC induction front & switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output & get double the burn-in."
2018-05-19,Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive & performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.

2018-05-16,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground & ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins
2018-05-14,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
2018-05-14,"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."
2018-05-14,What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
2018-05-14,"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tesla-with-autopilot-slams-into-truck-stopped-at-red-light/2018/05/12/18d2e740-563e-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.7466cb626644"
2018-05-14,Yes
2018-05-14,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
2018-05-14,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
2018-05-14,Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you so much.
2018-05-14,"Fair criticism, but we’re fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
2018-05-14,Lovely story
2018-05-13,"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I can’t figure them out."
2018-05-13,"SpaceX will prob build 30 to 40 rocket cores for ~300 missions over 5 years. Then BFR takes over & Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars & eventually outer planets."
2018-05-13,Good piece by Ars
2018-05-12,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
2018-05-12,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines — quaint, but not something you’d actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines & trains in general."
2018-05-12,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
2018-05-12,Yo
2018-05-11,Will make that a setting
2018-05-11,"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week"
2018-05-11,No use arguing with chimp. You’re blocked.
2018-05-11,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla & SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass …"
2018-05-11,I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever …
2018-05-11,Launching in ~4 mins
2018-05-11,"AWD & white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, that’s when we *start* making them. Can’t instantly fill all orders. Will take 6+ months to do so."
2018-05-11,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange …"
2018-05-11,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
2018-05-11,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD & performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
2018-05-11,A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
2018-05-11,Already started DC to NY route. Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true @Hyperloop w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels &amp; faster than jetliner.
2018-05-11,First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final… https://www.instagram.com/p/BinoVT6Acpd/?utm_source=ig_twitter_share
2018-05-11,"Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country & will be there in person for the launch."
2018-05-11,"This will work on entire S & X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
2018-05-10,"All X & S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high & you enable feature"
2018-05-10,"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"
2018-05-10,!! Unnecessary characters. Will change.

2018-05-09,"That’s a white rose on my jacket & the choker is a bunch of spikes, not Tesla anything"
2018-05-09,This chart shows how crazy low payout is to labels & the artists only a small fraction of these numbers
2018-05-09,"Prob iTunes, but whatever works 4u is fine. Most people don’t buy music & artist earnings from streaming are tiny. Mostly about touring. https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/art-angels/1051022913"

2018-05-05,I try so hard to help them …
2018-05-05,Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
2018-05-05,"Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you’re short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit …"
2018-05-04,New Roadster will have that
2018-05-04,"Yes, definitely not"
2018-05-04,It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
2018-05-04,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
2018-05-04,Yup
2018-05-04,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
2018-05-04,"We went through the same drama on S & X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
2018-05-04,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
2018-05-04,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
2018-05-04,"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
2018-05-04,Exactly
2018-05-04,"First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market & has been for a while"
2018-05-04,Please ignore this thread unless you’re interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
2018-05-04,They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
2018-05-04,"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S & X are producing major positive cash flow & Model 3 is about to do same."
2018-05-04,"To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
2018-05-04,"The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."
2018-05-03,You’re most welcome
2018-05-02,Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is 3rd in world after a place &amp; mall. Giga will be largest when complete.

2018-04-18,Russia has great rocket technology & talent. Much respect. Would encourage focus on reusability. Single-use rockets cannot be competitive any more than single-use aircraft.

2018-04-13,"Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
2018-04-13,"The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now it’s just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable & cash flow+ in Q3 & Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
2018-04-13,"Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is 3 to 6 months."
2018-04-13,Looking into it. This is bizarre.

2018-04-08,Similar timing
2018-04-08,So probably July
2018-04-08,We need to achieve 5k/week with Model 3 before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp
2018-04-08,"This is kinda nutty for such a short distance, so could easily end up being shredded metal, but exciting either way"
2018-04-08,Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
2018-04-08,Model 3 is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.

2018-04-02,"About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering & production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng & prod better aligned, so we don’t design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide & conquer, so I’m back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell …"
2018-04-02,"Can’t believe you’re even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what’s most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering."
2018-04-02,"We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn’t matter."
2018-04-02,"Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I’m sure there’s a really great answer …"
2018-04-02,"Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries & deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
2018-04-02,"Seriously! Obviously, I’m not going to do an April Fool’s joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
2018-04-02,"Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately & always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."
2018-04-02,"Oh yeah, forgot to mention it actually landed fine, just not on Mr Steven"

2018-04-01,"Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by ""Teslaquilla"" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks. This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point? Happy New Month!"
2018-04-01,"There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter 14 and a half (the worst one)."
2018-04-01,"Tesla Goes Bankrupt Palo Alto, California, April 1, 2018 -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it."

2018-03-24,It’s not a political statement and I didn’t do this because someone dared me to do it. Just don’t like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry.
2018-03-24,I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness & safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
2018-03-23,You’ll live
2018-03-23,We’ve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
2018-03-23,"Instagram’s probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I don’t use FB & never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so … don’t care."
2018-03-23,Ok
2018-03-23,"What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!"
2018-03-23,"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."

2018-03-23,Literally never seen it even once
2018-03-23,"Yeah, it’s borderline. FB influence is slowly creeping in."
2018-03-23,I didn’t realize there was one. Will do.

2018-02-12,"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high."
2018-02-12,"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
2018-02-12,"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

2018-01-15,Done
2018-01-15,"Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
2018-01-13,There aren’t even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
2018-01-12,"Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original."
2018-01-09,That sounds cool. Will do.

2017-12-26,"Yeah, it’s terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized."
2017-12-26,Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I’d like to add.
2017-12-26,"Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model 3 ramp."

2017-12-26,Should be in next update
2017-12-26,Done
2017-12-26,I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it.
2017-12-26,"Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so it’s going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience."
2017-12-26,"Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail. So much blood, sweat & tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you’d truly love. I hope you do. How can we improve further?"
2017-12-25,"We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks."
2017-12-25,The circle is complete

2017-12-21,I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart
2017-12-21,"However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive."
2017-12-21,"Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out."
2017-12-21,"For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses."
2017-12-21,"Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren’t (having “PhD” in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That’s what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit “expert”."
2017-12-21,Glad to see that Tesla owners are having a good experience. Working to improve further. Some cool software updates coming soon.
2017-12-21,Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. Will get it fixed.

2017-08-27,"Exactly. Wouldn't let anyone invest more than a token amount in early rounds of SpaceX and Tesla, as the probability of failure was >90%."

2017-08-27,"Sorry! Coming next year, along with completing the Trans-Canada Highway and interconnecting US, Mexico and Central America."
2017-08-27,"Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
2017-08-27,Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
2017-08-27,I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.
2017-08-27,"The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run, so livestream is not the way to go."
2017-08-27,"From last year, but still my favorite video of the Falcon 9 rocket booster returning from space… https://www.instagram.com/p/BYTrSaHgS-Z/"
2017-08-27,SpaceX and The Boring Company are running the Hyperloop competition
2017-08-26,"Tesla does not really have ""TTunes"". That's a joke."
2017-08-26,"Will be hanging with my little chum, Gary, on Sunday"
2017-08-25,Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here: 
2017-08-25,It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
2017-08-25,WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
2017-08-25,Neuralink is not raising money
2017-08-25,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
2017-08-25,"Max velocity: Mach 6.9 Max altitude: 247 km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
2017-08-25,Probably 2m or so
2017-08-25,Exactly. Yeah.
2017-08-25,Intentionally? Yes
2017-08-25,It is approximately the size of a carrot
2017-08-25,Touchdown: Vertical Velocity (m/s): -1.47 Lateral Velocity (m/s): -0.15 Tilt (deg): 0.40 ​ Lateral position: 0.7m from target center
2017-08-25,Falcon 9 boost stage on droneship Just Read the Instructions
2017-08-23,"A midnight amendment, followed by a vigorously opposed subpoena. Someone has been naughty …"
2017-08-23,I played those games :)
2017-08-23,"That's a SpaceX engineer in there, not me"

2017-08-23,"Yeah. It's kinda disgusting, but my boys and I love it :)"

2017-08-22,"I would say that @TheOnion is the greatest publication in the history of all conscious beings, living or dead"
2017-08-22,"I'm not the CEO of Ball Mason Jars. Also, not judging …"
2017-08-22,Was at a friend's party this weekend and drank wine from a mason jar
2017-08-22,I can't hide the truth any more …
2017-08-21,Yes :)
2017-08-21,Watching eclipse with sunglasses on through the Model S glass roof. Wow!
2017-08-21,SpaceX rocket factory as seen from space https://www.instagram.com/p/BYCjs0bgmNl/
2017-08-20,"Yeah, but not a priority right now"
2017-08-20,I'm not coming for anything. Just digging some tunnels and might draw a vacuum on some of them.
2017-08-20,"We are going to move all info and settings to the ""cloud"" (aka server) so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you"
2017-08-20,Pics of SpaceX spacesuit developed for NASA commercial crew program coming out next week. Undergoing ocean landing mobility/safety tests.
2017-08-19,Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
2017-08-19,At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
2017-08-19,Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
2017-08-19,Will prob do something like that
2017-08-19,Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
2017-08-19,"Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
2017-08-19,"Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"
2017-08-19,Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.
2017-08-18,I love Kermit
2017-08-18,"But you can check it out on @9GAGTweets. Btw, this isn't a video, like cliff diving or fake rocket landings, that matters if it's reversed."
2017-08-18,Wigs me out too much. Deleting ...
2017-08-14,"Yes, just that the permitting process is slow"
2017-08-14,I want one too!
2017-08-14,"Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size, but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a Model X!"
2017-08-14,"The danger is def high for South Korea, due to proximity, but much less for distant targets like the US. SK anti-missile tech is excellent."
2017-08-14,"We certainly could, but, while not suggesting complacency, I'm confident that the US DoD and intelligence orgs have this covered"

2017-08-12,For sure
2017-08-12,Biggest impediment to recognizing AI danger are those so convinced of their own intelligence they can't imagine anyone doing what they can't
2017-08-12,Would like to express our appreciation to Microsoft for use of their Azure cloud computing platform. This required massive processing power.
2017-08-12,OpenAI + Dota 2
2017-08-12,It is far too complex for that. Requires a team of the world's best AI researchers with massive computing resources.
2017-08-12,"Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too."
2017-08-12,"I sure hope so, but we can't take that for granted"
2017-08-12,"If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea."
2017-08-12,OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess & Go.

2017-08-11,A level 9 orc illusionist and dressmaker
2017-08-11,This is about as true as TIME being a paragon of great journalism. Please spend at least 8 seconds checking your facts.
2017-08-11,Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a ninja. That requires years of training.
2017-08-11,There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don't really matter & maybe 5 to 10 that do. Guess I could post for those interested.
2017-08-11,"One other I'd like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that's a joke. Didn't say that either."
2017-08-11,"MB was given 52 weeks of salary & stock in appreciation for her great contribution & left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist"
2017-08-11,"Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over 10 yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist"
2017-08-11,"Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."
2017-08-11,"Ashlee Vance's biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors & never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so"
2017-08-10,Major increases in the Supercharger and Tesla urban charger network happening over the next several months

2017-08-06,I agree. Working on it ...
2017-08-06,It's only a matter of time
2017-08-06,y
2017-08-06,"True, although the changemyview subreddit is least likely to be clicked on by people who really should change their view"
2017-08-06,"Arguments, followed, of course, by complaints"
2017-08-06,Are you complaining that we are not complaining enough?
2017-08-06,And let's not forget the forum on which we are posting… I've heard - now this is just a rumor - that people say mean things on Twitter.
2017-08-05,Like I said ...
2017-08-05,It gets really dark
2017-08-05,"True, there are frequent complaint expansion packs"
2017-08-05,Except for complaining. That has remained constant throughout history at 100/100.
2017-08-05,Officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed 1000km on a single charge! Congratulations Tesla Owners Italia!!
2017-08-04,I guess a proof of concept is needed

2017-07-31,Umm ...
2017-07-30,"Yeah, it's better than a Model 3. We can put a lot more in a car at a higher price."
2017-07-30,"I'm sure there are better answers than what I do, which is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you're doing"
2017-07-30,"If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn't fair to blame hell ..."
2017-07-30,"Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for."
2017-07-30,Yeah
2017-07-30,"The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to hear about the last two."

2017-07-29,Yes
2017-07-29,Sure
2017-07-29,"Watched them personally to make sure & I agree with the outcome. Wouldn't have judged differently. Amazing videos all, but @MKBHD was best."

2017-07-21,Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated.
2017-07-21,Kinda have to :)
2017-07-21,LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries & motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
2017-07-21,"Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state & city discussions."
2017-07-21,Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
2017-07-20,"An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
2017-07-20,City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
2017-07-20,"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local & federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
2017-07-20,"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
2017-07-20,For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
2017-07-20,Support would be much appreciated!
2017-07-20,"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"

2017-07-17,Not true. Email from customer.
2017-07-17,"I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past & present, but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly …"

2017-07-14,Yes
2017-07-14,Stay tuned
2017-07-14,I told you it was verbose. Better tomorrow :)
2017-07-14,"Excited to announce the launch of http://x.com! It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow."
2017-07-14,Just checked and yes
2017-07-14,"True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon 9. Falcon Heavy is needed ..."
2017-07-14,Commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. SpaceX is not allowed to compete for many US and non-US launches.

2017-07-05,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.
2017-07-04,We're going to spend the 4th doing a full review of rocket & pad systems. Launch no earlier than 5th/6th. Only one chance to get it right …
2017-07-03,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.

2017-06-28,No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
2017-06-26,"Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long."
2017-06-26,"Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack & peak heating is the cube of speed, so a Mach 8 reentry is 8X Mach 4. Intense."

2017-06-25,Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
2017-06-25,"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
2017-06-25,"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds."
2017-06-25,"They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power & energy, but rocket has plenty of that."
2017-06-25,"Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups"

2017-06-23,"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
2017-06-23,Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.

2017-06-09,Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
2017-06-09,Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly & are reluctant to adopt new tech.
2017-06-09,"I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama … Prob worth doing?"
2017-06-09,Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only 7% of parts ended up being common.
2017-06-09,"Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover."
2017-06-09,"The faster, the better. Gravity losses."
2017-06-09,Damn Stonecutters!
2017-06-09,"Was no ""company"", just a (wrong) biz plan to commercialize ACP's Tzero car. No tech or IP, no employees & didn't even own Tesla Motors name."
2017-06-09,"Disruption certainly. Deep AI is the real risk, though, not automation."
2017-06-09,Exactly
2017-06-09,Congrats Robb!

2017-05-23,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
2017-05-22,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
2017-05-22,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
2017-05-22,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
2017-05-22,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
2017-05-22,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian & cyclist safety"
2017-05-22,Exactly
2017-05-22,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
2017-05-22,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
2017-05-22,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
2017-05-22,Hopefully June for those too
2017-05-22,S for sure. It is a bigger car.
2017-05-22,"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3."
2017-05-22,"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
2017-05-22,"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
2017-05-22,"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
2017-05-22,That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
2017-05-22,Almost there. Probably in a few months.
2017-05-22,"You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off :)"
2017-05-22,Something cool for sure
2017-05-22,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.

2017-05-05,Thinking about a name for our first tunneling machine …
2017-05-04,Was just rereading one of my favorites. So beautiful …
2017-05-01,"Close-up of rocket stage separation, fast flip, boostback burn in a ring of fire and then… https://www.instagram.com/p/BTjVdLVB1bO/"
2017-05-01,Landing https://www.instagram.com/p/BTjUcEYBqSQ/
2017-05-01,"Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good. Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6% of the theoretical load limit."
2017-05-01,"Winds aloft are unusually high (still within structural safety bounds). Worrying, but not a showstopper."
2017-05-01,"Yeah, will probably publish an update in six weeks or so"
2017-05-01,My boring TED talk
2017-04-28,Couldn't agree more
2017-04-28,Extremely
2017-04-28,Even more boring
2017-04-28,Boring
2017-04-27,"We def want to avoid either, particularly Surface Detail ..."
2017-04-24,On it now
2017-04-24,"Great food, great ambience and with great friends. We all really enjoyed the visit."
2017-04-24,Will definitely do that on my next trip
2017-04-23,"Having moo moo at Moo Moo Gold Coast with amberheard, @CreepyPuppet and @CowanFilms https://www.instagram.com/p/BTPyhtBhdn6/"
2017-04-23,That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.
2017-04-18,"Yeah, sorry I missed that. This would only work for 75 kWh packs that are software created to 60, so not 2013."
2017-04-17,Yes
2017-04-17,Tesla will soon be offering a compelling means of upgrading a 60 to a 75
2017-04-13,July
2017-04-13,Pickup truck unveil in 18 to 24 months
2017-04-13,Next gen Roadster will be convertible
2017-04-13,Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.
2017-04-12,Yeah
2017-04-12,"Besides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it."
2017-04-12,This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...
2017-04-12,Autolist survey finds Tesla used car values are highest and sell fastest
2017-04-07,"Fairing is ~$5M, but that should be reusable this year. Am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to 100%."
2017-04-07,Latency should only be 5 min max. Checking ...
2017-04-07,Feature coming soon that allows one touch access to all discovered Tesla Easter eggs
2017-04-05,And so the robots spared humanity ...
2017-04-03,"Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows."
2017-04-03,"Et tu, Walt?"
2017-04-03,Stormy weather in Shortville ...
2017-04-02,Coal is dying due to nat gas fracking. It's basically dead.
2017-04-02,It's just a helicopter in helicopter's clothing
2017-04-02,It won't matter
2017-04-02,Pretty good
2017-04-01,"Why did we waste so much time developing silly rockets? Damn you, aliens! So obtuse! You have all this crazy tech, but can't speak English!?"
2017-04-01,Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation
2017-04-01,"Def P100D with Ludicrous+, although the rocket starts going a lot faster after that"
2017-03-31,We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
2017-03-31,Working on it
2017-03-31,Looks like it could do 20% more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
2017-03-31,A lot
2017-03-31,Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of 1st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend & Monty Python.
2017-03-31,"Good point, odds go from 0% to >0% :)"
2017-03-31,Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
2017-03-31,"Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot."
2017-03-31,Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob 6 weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
2017-03-31,Thanks Phil!
2017-03-30,Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.
2017-03-29,"If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times"
2017-03-29,"On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance."
2017-03-28,Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model 3.
2017-03-28,Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
2017-03-28,No
2017-03-28,You won't care
2017-03-28,What gave me away?
2017-03-28,No
2017-03-28,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon & into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...
2017-03-28,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
2017-03-24,We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
2017-03-24,Yes
2017-03-24,Yes
2017-03-24,I believe so
2017-03-24,Yup
2017-03-24,Oh so little faith
2017-03-24,The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
2017-03-24,Yeah
2017-03-24,Start taking orders in April
2017-03-24,"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
2017-03-24,"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles …"
2017-03-24,The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
2017-03-24,"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
2017-03-24,No problem :)
2017-03-24,"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
2017-03-24,Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
2017-03-24,"First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months."
2017-03-24,Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
2017-03-24,First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3
2017-03-24,It still has one display
2017-03-24,Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
2017-03-24,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
2017-03-24,How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
2017-03-24,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
2017-03-24,I think so
2017-03-24,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
2017-03-24,Tues/Wed
2017-03-24,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
2017-03-24,Tues/Wed next week
2017-03-24,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
2017-03-24,"Yes, but not until next year"
2017-03-24,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
2017-03-24,"Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
2017-03-24,How about now?
2017-03-24,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
2017-03-24,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
2017-03-24,Definitely
2017-03-24,"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
2017-03-24,Yes
2017-03-24,"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
2017-03-24,"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
2017-03-24,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
2017-03-24,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
2017-03-24,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
2017-03-24,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
2017-03-24,"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
2017-03-24,I hope that didn't work
2017-03-24,~spawn npc.alien
2017-03-24,Where are the #%*> aliens?
2017-03-23,Looks like Tues/Wed for 8.1 release
2017-03-22,Except that isn't actually my house ...
2017-03-22,"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
2017-03-22,I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
2017-03-16,"3 is a great car, but definitely Model S"
2017-03-14,Good point
2017-03-14,I wish. It's so annoying.
2017-03-14,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ..."
2017-03-13,Ok
2017-03-12,"It's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results"
2017-03-12,"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
2017-03-12,"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
2017-03-12,"Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
2017-03-12,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes"
2017-03-12,I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
2017-03-12,"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
2017-03-12,High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current
2017-03-12,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power & electronics both DC."
2017-03-12,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.
2017-03-11,"Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
2017-03-10,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
2017-03-10,$250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
2017-03-10,Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
2017-03-06,Will send you one
2017-03-06,Self-hatred
2017-03-06,Thanks JJ!
2017-03-06,
2017-03-02,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!
2017-02-28,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.
2017-02-28,"This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it 7 or 8 times ever."
2017-02-27,Fly me to the moon ... Ok
2017-02-27,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST
2017-02-25,of course
2017-02-25,maybe one of those too
2017-02-25,Roller coasters are awesome
2017-02-24,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
2017-02-24,Good chance it will
2017-02-24,Exactly :)
2017-02-24,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
2017-02-24,Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
2017-02-23,Excellent Tesla Model X review
2017-02-19,Just posted a video https://www.instagram.com/p/BQtNTk4Brqp/
2017-02-19,
2017-02-19,Baby came back https://www.instagram.com/p/BQspL7Qhv1v/
2017-02-19,no
2017-02-18,System was green for launch. I called it off.
2017-02-18,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018."
2017-02-18,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
2017-02-18,"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
2017-02-18,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
2017-02-18,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
2017-02-18,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
2017-02-18,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast… https://www.instagram.com/p/BQpXxl5BIYX/
2017-02-18,spacex's photo https://instagram.com/p/BQnwNNsFy-3/
2017-02-18,"Provided Dragon 2 demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in 2018"
2017-02-18,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
2017-02-17,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow."
2017-02-17,"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"
2017-02-17,It's much easier to do the CGI that way
2017-02-16,Daylight rocket launch & landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the 1st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.
2017-02-16,I used that one :)
2017-02-16,"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much."
2017-02-16,They are doing India proud
2017-02-16,You may come to regret that request :)
2017-02-16,"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
2017-02-16,"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
2017-02-16,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
2017-02-16,"You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man..."
2017-02-15,they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
2017-02-15,"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited."
2017-02-15,Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
2017-02-15,Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
2017-02-11,Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
2017-02-10,Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A. This is the same launch… https://www.instagram.com/p/BQWBz9zgOTP/
2017-02-10,Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
2017-02-10,"Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday."
2017-02-09,of course it will
2017-02-08,Should all be uploaded by next month
2017-02-08,Motor Trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the Porsche 918
2017-02-08,I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
2017-02-08,George Schultz and Jim Baker article in @WSJ regarding a carbon tax
2017-02-07,yes
2017-02-07,Hoping for summer this year
2017-02-07,"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
2017-02-07,"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100."
2017-02-07,"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
2017-02-07,"No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."
2017-02-07,Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.
2017-02-07,yes
2017-02-07,Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to 60 mph in 2.27 sec
2017-02-05,Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
2017-02-05,No rare earth metals in battery
2017-02-05,Almost ready
2017-02-05,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
2017-02-05,"Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority"
2017-02-05,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
2017-02-05,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
2017-02-05,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
2017-02-05,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text"
2017-02-05,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
2017-02-05,Rolling out a new update today.
2017-02-05,We should try our best
2017-02-05,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
2017-02-05,I just had three coffees :)
2017-02-05,Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it

2017-02-05,Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
2017-02-05,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
2017-02-05,True. Me being one of them :)
2017-02-05,"Not perfect & cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
2017-02-05,"Fair point, sorry"
2017-02-05,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
2017-02-05,Exactly
2017-02-05,Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
2017-02-05,Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
2017-02-05,"Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
2017-02-05,"Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)"
2017-02-05,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
2017-02-05,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
2017-02-05,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
2017-02-05,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
2017-02-05,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
2017-02-05,Mostly anti-drug laws
2017-02-05,Exactly
2017-02-05,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
2017-02-05,The remedy for that is changing the law
2017-02-05,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
2017-02-05,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
2017-02-05,True!
2017-02-05,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
2017-02-04,Walking down the street and saw this
2017-02-04,I wish!
2017-02-04,"Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism."
2017-02-04,"Wow, cool!"
2017-02-04,That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
2017-02-04,Nuances are important :)
2017-02-04,26 ft diameter tunnel running 2 miles under D.C.
2017-02-04,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
2017-02-04,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
2017-02-04,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
2017-02-04,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"
2017-02-04,First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.
2017-02-04,maybe

2017-02-04,"Yes. Green cards & dual citizens already ok. Work & spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action."
2017-02-04,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
2017-02-03,Regarding the meeting at the White House:
2017-02-02,yes
2017-01-31,Headline & article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.
2017-01-30,"Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity"
2017-01-30,Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI
2017-01-30,"I agree with creating great jobs, restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting"
2017-01-30,"Yeah, sorry about that :)"

2016-10-09,Probably not then either
2016-10-09,Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary for either.
2016-10-09,"Tesla product unveiling on the 17th (unexpected by most), followed by Tesla/SolarCity on the 28th"
2016-10-09,I agree. Speed of light is a point in favor of the sim.
2016-10-07,"US automotive deaths rose 10% to 17,775 in first half of 2016, approx 1 every 88 million miles"
2016-10-07,Cumulative Tesla Autopilot miles now at 222 million
2016-10-07,lot of circumstantial evidence for that hypothesis

2016-09-21,all cars
2016-09-21,can't always detect babies and pets
2016-09-21,Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
2016-09-21,Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin & turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
2016-09-21,My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
2016-09-21,This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
2016-09-21,"V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments."

2016-09-09,"@abadcliche Most likely true, but we can't yet find it on any vehicle sensors"
2016-09-09,Will get back to Autopilot update blog tomorrow.
2016-09-09,We have not ruled that out.
2016-09-09,"nope, it wasn't me"
2016-09-09,Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
2016-09-09,"Support & advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA &amp; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com."
2016-09-09,Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
2016-09-09,Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
2016-09-09,It's been a little crazy lately
2016-09-01,"yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine."
2016-09-01,Finishing Autopilot blog postponed to end of weekend
2016-09-01,Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.
2016-08-31,"Not allowed, according to HK regulations. Happy to do it if regs change."
2016-08-31,We need to do one more minor rev on 8.0 and then will go to wide release in a few weeks
2016-08-31,Writing post now with details. Will publish on Tesla website later today.

2016-08-07,Sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots
2016-08-01,Never. There is no product rationale for doing so.
2016-07-31,probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis
2016-07-31,Model Y (compact SUV) off Model 3 chassis. Tesla Bus/Minibus/Spacebus off Model X.
2016-07-30,good point

2016-07-17,"Tesla customers are v smart & don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: 0.0% want it disabled -- not 0.1%, 0.0%."
2016-07-17,"It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything >= water density) detection"
2016-07-17,Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
2016-07-17,Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.
2016-07-17,That is a very good point!

2016-07-15,"Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust"
2016-07-15,yes
2016-07-15,certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
2016-07-15,effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving

2016-07-10,US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
2016-07-10,Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
2016-07-10,"It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
2016-07-10,"With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
2016-07-10,"Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
2016-07-10,exactly
2016-07-10,"that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
2016-07-10,why?
2016-07-10,thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
2016-07-10,Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
2016-07-10,"you're right, no point"
2016-07-10,"Use of word ""beta"" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense."

2016-07-06,The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.

2016-06-12,Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
2016-06-12,"That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics"
2016-06-12,"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"

2016-06-11,"Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious."
2016-06-10,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
2016-06-10,"Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
2016-06-10,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
2016-06-10,That is correct. It was about innovation.
2016-06-10,Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on @TopGear_BBCA
2016-06-09,no
2016-06-09,Something about a flying metal suit...
2016-06-08,yes
2016-06-08,S and X cells are also Panasonic
2016-06-08,Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model 3 cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.
2016-06-07,Fourth rocket arrives in the hangar. Aiming for first reflight in Sept/Oct.
2016-06-06,"PC, of course"
2016-06-05,Highly recommend @PlayOverwatch by the good people of @Blizzard_Ent if you like ultrafast team FPS action
2016-06-05,Trippy
2016-06-05,@Recode I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
2016-06-04,Exactly
2016-06-04,Good article from @themotleyfool explaining how little incentives have actually contributed to Tesla funding
2016-06-04,how did you know?
2016-06-04,Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
2016-06-04,exactly

2016-06-03,control of super powerful AI by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
2016-06-03,Just heard that Norway will ban new sales of fuel cars in 2025. What an amazingly awesome country. You guys rock!!

2016-06-01,Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by @katiefehren
2016-05-30,Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this & investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
2016-05-29,So it was good for you too ...
2016-05-28,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
2016-05-28,"Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
2016-05-27,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
2016-05-27,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max & used up contingency crush core, hence back & forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
2016-05-27,"Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good."
2016-05-27,3 mins to launch
2016-05-26,"There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
2016-05-25,Really fun Model X review by @MotorTrend. Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ib-02b2ooLY
2016-05-22,"Flight 24 is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
2016-05-19,Great image of ancient Mars
2016-05-18,"No prob. We care about doing what's fair & just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there & we make amends when wrong"
2016-05-18,"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
2016-05-18,"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
2016-05-18,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less & less of the Merc story appears to be true"
2016-05-18,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
2016-05-17,"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
2016-05-16,Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
2016-05-16,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
2016-05-16,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
2016-05-16,Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
2016-05-16,"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
2016-05-16,yes
2016-05-16,yup
2016-05-15,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."
2016-05-15,Three's company
2016-05-14,will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
2016-05-14,Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.
2016-05-14,Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!
2016-05-12,también te amo
2016-05-12,It's probably the Ambien
2016-05-12,Definitely
2016-05-12,Ok
2016-05-12,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.
2016-05-10,@vicentes @TeslaMotors @Tim_Stevens @CNET coming soon
2016-05-07,@tzepr Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
2016-05-07,@LifeOfRockstar I think so
2016-05-07,@lukealization Max is just 3X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
2016-05-07,I love you too!
2016-05-06,"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to 36,000 km above Earth"
2016-05-06,@hansmikael @TeslaMotors Thank goodness all are ok
2016-05-06,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
2016-05-06,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
2016-05-06,Woohoo!!
2016-05-06,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
2016-05-05,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery"
2016-05-05,@samsamlee777 yes

2016-05-01,"@MacTechGenius @SacEV Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
2016-05-01,@JohanMancus Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
2016-05-01,@SacEV next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
2016-05-01,@scottymeuk @DericLew @SpaceflightIns @phillipcjackson exactly
2016-05-01,"@_andyoneal sides def, center maybe"
2016-05-01,@CyberdineX naturally
2016-05-01,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
2016-05-01,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
2016-05-01,"@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"
2016-04-30,"@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
2016-04-30,@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
2016-04-30,@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
2016-04-30,"@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin."
2016-04-30,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy
2016-04-30,@dannysparker yes
2016-04-30,@phillipcjackson turns out it doesn't need securing
2016-04-30,@Mini_Elon yes
2016-04-30,"@vicentes @gdoehne yes, several times"
2016-04-30,@jbdeck for sure :)
2016-04-30,@Tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly
2016-04-30,@RokBottomGamers 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
2016-04-30,@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
2016-04-30,"@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
2016-04-30,@MrBoylan System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
2016-04-30,@vigneshraju of course
2016-04-30,@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
2016-04-29,"@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely."
2016-04-29,@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
2016-04-29,@erothenberg checking into it ...
2016-04-27,@romn8tr will definitely do so
2016-04-27,"@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
2016-04-27,"@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
2016-04-27,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
2016-04-27,Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
2016-04-24,"@KristianNairn A 3 should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
2016-04-20,@scottmcnealy That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
2016-04-20,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well :)
2016-04-20,"@dannysparker Aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months, pending detailed examination and 10X refiring of a returned booster"
2016-04-20,@RealDarthBL We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
2016-04-20,By land and sea

2016-04-03,@AlexBelohlavek less
2016-04-03,@torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
2016-04-03,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
2016-04-03,"Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."

2016-04-03,@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
2016-04-03,@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
2016-04-03,@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system
2016-04-03,@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
2016-04-03,@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
2016-04-03,@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
2016-04-03,@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
2016-04-03,@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
2016-04-03,@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
2016-04-03,@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
2016-04-03,"A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
2016-04-03,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
2016-04-03,@RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
2016-04-03,@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
2016-04-03,@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
